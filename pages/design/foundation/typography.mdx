# Typography

These guidelines summarize how we use typography at GitHub, and serve as guardrails for designers to design freely with best typographic practices in mind.

<!-- {:toc} -->

## Typefaces

We utilize system fonts at GitHub, which allow for optimized performance. This design decision takes advantage of retina screens, dynamic kerning, additional font-weights, and improved readability.

Do not tailor your designs specifically around a certain typeface, as across interfaces and platforms they are subject to change. Each font has slightly different letter spacing, baseline, cap-height, and x-height which means we can not rely on the exact display of a single font. For this reason we recommend avoiding apply specific widths that rely on the total height or width of a given text.

The most commonly used system-fonts are listed below. However, this isn’t a finite list, so keep in mind that typographic implementations may vary between browser settings and operating systems.

[San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) is a neo grotesque sans-serif typeface designed by Apple to replace Helvetica Neue for OSX and iOS

[Segoe UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/resources) is a humanist sans-serif adopted by Microsoft as it's default operating system font since Windows Vista

[Ubuntu](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/) is an OpenType-based, humanist sans-serif typeface. It became the default system font for Ubuntu 10.10 and is commonly used on Linux distros.

## Font-stack

**Default:**

```
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI",
Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
```

**Monospace:**

```
$mono-font: "SFMono-Regular", Consolas, "Liberation Mono", Menlo, Courier, monospace !default;
```

## Type Scale and Line-height

The typography scale is designed to work for GitHub's product UI and marketing sites. Font sizes are designed to work in combination with line-height values so as to result in more sensible numbers wherever possible.

| Font size: desktop | 1.25 line-height | 1.5 line-height |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 12px               | 15               | 18              |
| 14px               | 17.5             | 21              |
| 16px               | 20               | 24              |
| 20px               | 25               | 30              |
| 24px               | 30               | 36              |
| 32px               | 40               | 48              |
| 40px               | 50               | 60              |
| 48px               | 60               | 72              |

### Marketing Typography Scale

Our Marketing Typography Scale aligns with our core typography scale, except for one additional header size:

| Font size: mobile | Font size: desktop | 1.25 line height | 1.5 line height |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 48px              | 64px               | 80               | 96              |

Marketing Typography also incorporates [Inter UI](https://rsms.me/inter/) as a display face, and other stylistic details are unique in building their products.

## Readability

When incorporating different type sizes, weights, and styling in designs keep this to a minimum for an overall cleaner and efficient reading experience for users. Whenever possible, utilize type styling provided by Primer. Documentation for this can be found in Primer's [Typography Utilities](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/utilities/typography/).

- **Hierarchy**—Type hierarchies are established in our products using size, weight, and rules. Reserve color for more specialized use cases in defining a product’s hierarchy. It’s best practice to identify body and display content first, then utilize the appropriate type scale in order to make hierarchy-defining decisions. After this has been established, adjust font-weight and add rules when appropriate. Technical documentation for implementing designs can be found in Primer's [Typography Utilities](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/utilities/typography/).
- **Line length**—It's considered good practice to keep lines around 80 characters or less—[W3 Page Structure Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/styling/). Cases vary depending on the situation, but this serves as a general rule of thumb for developing products at Github.
- **Line height**—Refer to our Typography Scale when structuring line height. Generally our products should follow this scale without issues.
- **Letter spacing**—Please refrain from altering letter-spacing on our products. There may be rare scenarios in which this is acceptable, but generally speaking this should be avoided altogether.
- **Type alignment**—Our content is typically left-aligned and ragged right. Be sensible in deviating from this standard, as justifying, centering, and right-aligning text is atypical of Github products. For more information, please refer to the documentation of our [type utilities](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/utilities/typography/).

## Iterate and Componentize

When certain typographic patterns in your design emerge, or you believe a certain solution should be made into a component, reach out to the [#design-systems](https://github.slack.com/messages/C0ZCGGGJ2) channel on Slack to find out more on submitting your code or idea. You may also reach out by opening an issue to the team the team directly on [Github](https://github.com/primer/primer).
