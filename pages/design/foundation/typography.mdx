# Typography

These guidelines summarize how we use typography at GitHub, and serve as guardrails for designers to design freely with best typographic practices in mind.

## Typefaces

We utilize system fonts at GitHub, which allow for optimized performance. This design decision takes advantage of retina screens, dynamic kerning, additional font-weights, and improved readability.

The most commonly used system-fonts are listed below. However, this isn’t a finite list, so keep in mind that typographic implementations may vary between browser settings and operating systems.

## Font-Stack

**Default:**

```
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI",
Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
```

**Monospace:**

```
$mono-font: "SFMono-Regular", Consolas, "Liberation Mono", Menlo, Courier, monospace !default;
```

## Type Scale and Line-Height

| Font size: mobile | Font size: desktop | 1.25 line height | 1.5 line height |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 40px              | 48px               | 60               | 72              |
| 32px              | 40px               | 50               | 60              |
| 26px              | 32px               | 40               | 48              |
| 22px              | 24px               | 30               | 36              |
| 18px              | 20px               | 25               | 30              |
| 16px              | 16px               | 20               | 24              |
| 14px              | 14px               | 17.5             | 21              |
| 12px              | 12px               | 15               | 18              |

Our Marketing Typography Scale aligns with our core typography scale, except for one additional header size:

| Font size: mobile | Font size: desktop | 1.25 line height | 1.5 line height |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 48px              | 64px               | 80               | 96              |

## Principles of Usage

### Utilize components:

Primer has many typographic solutions that have been created for developers and designers. Please utilize them whenever possible, as they've been specifically designed to help individuals build GitHub products. Some of them include:

- [Alerts](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/alerts/)
- [Labels](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/labels/)
- [Subheads](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/subhead/)
- [Navigation](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/navigation/)

### Usage:

Do not tailor your designs specifically around a certain typeface, as across interfaces and platforms they are subject to change. Because our font-stack defaults to system-fonts, it is important for designers to be aware of this fact when making design decisions.

Please refer to the [Typefaces](#Typefaces) section of this document to access our font-stack and additional resources.

### Best Practices:

- **Use Sensible Line-Lengths:** Line length is important to consider when designing with body text in mind. It's considered good practice to keep lines around 80 characters or less—[W3 Page Structure Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/styling/). Cases vary depending on the situation, but this serves as a general rule of thumb for developing products at Github.

- **_Establish Clear Hierarchy:_** Usually type hierarchies are established in our products using size, weight, and rules. Reserve color for more specialized use cases in defining a product’s hierarchy. It’s best practice to identify body and display content first, then utilize the appropriate type scale in order to make hierarchy-defining decisions. After this has been established, adjust font-weight and add rules when appropriate. More technical documentation can be found [here](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/support/typography/).

- **_Keep Type Consistent_** Be sensible when incorporating different type sizes, weights, and styling in designs. Try to keep this to a minimum for an overall cleaner and efficient reading experience for users. Whenever possible, utilize type styling provided by Primer. Documentation for this can be found in Primer's [Typography Utilities](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/utilities/typography/).

- **_Alignment and Paragraph Styling_** Our content is typically left-aligned and ragged right. Be sensible in deviating from this standard, as justifying, centering, and right-aligning text is atypical of Github products. Full documentation of our type utilities can be found [here](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/utilities/typography/).

- **_Iterate and Componentize_** When certain typographic patterns in your design emerge, or you believe a certain solution should be made into a component, reach out to the #design-systems channel on Slack to find out more on submitting your code or idea. You may also reach out by opening an issue to the team the team directly on [Github](https://github.com/primer/primer).

## User Support

Typography can be tricky to deal with when iterating on new designs, and certain project may require extra support or guidance. If you have any sort of typographic related question when developing our products with Primer, please reach out to us via #design-systems on Slack, or on [Github](https://github.com/primer/primer).
