# Typography

These guidelines summarize how we use typography at GitHub, and serve as guardrails for designers to design freely with best typographic practices in mind.

<!-- {:toc} -->

## Typefaces

We utilize system fonts at GitHub, which allow for optimized performance. This design decision takes advantage of retina screens, dynamic kerning, additional font-weights, and improved readability.

Do not tailor your designs specifically around a certain typeface, as across interfaces and platforms they are subject to change. Each font has slightly different letter spacing, baseline, cap-height, and x-height which means we can not rely on the exact display of a single font.

The most commonly used system-fonts are listed below. However, this isn’t a finite list, so keep in mind that typographic implementations may vary between browser settings and operating systems.

<Box maxWidth={450}>
  <SF />
</Box>

[San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) is a neo grotesque sans-serif typeface designed by Apple to replace Helvetica Neue for OSX and iOS

<Box maxWidth={450}>
  <Segoe />
</Box>

[Segoe UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/resources) is a humanist sans-serif adopted by Microsoft as it's default operating system font since Windows Vista

<Box maxWidth={450}>
  <Ubuntu />
</Box>

[Ubuntu](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/) is an OpenType-based, humanist sans-serif typeface. It became the default system font for Ubuntu 10.10 and is commonly used on Linux distros.

### Font-stack

System Fonts:

```
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI",
Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
```

Monospace:

```
$mono-font: "SFMono-Regular", Consolas, "Liberation Mono", Menlo, Courier, monospace !default;
```

## Typography Scale and Line-height

The typography scale is designed to work for GitHub's product interfaces and marketing sites. Font sizes are designed to work in combination with line-height values so as to result in more sensible numbers wherever possible.

| Font size: desktop | 1.25 line-height | 1.5 line-height |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 12px               | 15               | 18              |
| 14px               | 17.5             | 21              |
| 16px               | 20               | 24              |
| 20px               | 25               | 30              |
| 24px               | 30               | 36              |
| 32px               | 40               | 48              |
| 40px               | 50               | 60              |
| 48px               | 60               | 72              |

### Marketing Typography Scale

Our Marketing Typography Scale aligns with our core typography scale, except for one additional header size:

| Font size: desktop | 1.25 line height | 1.5 line height |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 64px               | 80               | 96              |

Marketing Typography also incorporates [Inter UI](https://rsms.me/inter/) as a display face, and other stylistic details are unique in building their products.

## Applying Typography

When incorporating different type sizes, weights, and styling in designs, it is best practice to keep this to a minimum for an overall cleaner and efficient reading experience for users. Whenever possible, utilize type styling provided by Primer's [Typography Utilities](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/utilities/typography/).

### Hierarchy

Type hierarchies are established in our products using size, weight, and rules. It’s best practice to identify body and display content first, then utilize our type scale in order to make hierarchy-defining decisions. After this has been established, adjust font-weight and add rules when appropriate.

### Readability

- **Line height**—Refer to our Typography Scale when structuring line height. Generally our products should follow this scale without issues.

- **Line length**—It's considered good practice to keep lines around 80 characters or less—[W3 Page Structure Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/styling/). Cases vary depending on the situation, but this serves as a general rule of thumb for developing products at Github.
- **Type alignment**—Our content is typically left-aligned and ragged right. Be sensible in deviating from this standard, as justifying, centering, and right-aligning text is atypical of Github products.

### Styling

- **Font Weight**—Adjust font weight to add emphasis and differentiate content hierarchy. It's common practice for our buttons and headings to be bolded.

- **Letter spacing**—Please refrain from altering letter-spacing on our products. There may be rare scenarios in which this is acceptable, but generally speaking this should be avoided altogether.

## Support

### Iterate and Componentize

When certain typographic patterns in your design emerge, or you believe a certain solution should be made into a component, reach out to the [#design-systems](https://github.slack.com/messages/C0ZCGGGJ2) channel on Slack to find out more on submitting your code or idea. You may also reach out by opening an issue to the team the team directly on [Github](https://github.com/primer/primer).
