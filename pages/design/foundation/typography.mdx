# Typography

These guidelines summarize how we use typography at Github, and serve as guardrails for designers to design freely with best practices in mind.

## Typefaces

At Github, our teams utilize system-fonts, which allow for optimized performance. This design decision takes advantage of:

- retina screens
- dynamic kerning
- additional font-weights
- improved readability
- operating system-agnostic design

The most commonly used system fonts are listed below. However, this isn’t a finite list, so keep in mind that typographic implementations may vary between browser settings, operating systems, and font settings.

[Segoe UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/resources) for Windows

[San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for macOS and iOS

[Ubuntu](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/) for Linux (most commonly used of Linux distros)

## Font Stack

**Default:**

```
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI",
Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
```

**Monospace:**

```
$mono-font: "SFMono-Regular", Consolas, "Liberation Mono", Menlo, Courier, monospace !default;
```

## Type Scale and Line-Height

| Font size: mobile | Font size: desktop | 1.25 line height | 1.5 line height |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 40px              | 48px               | 60               | 72              |
| 32px              | 40px               | 50               | 60              |
| 26px              | 32px               | 40               | 48              |
| 22px              | 24px               | 30               | 36              |

| 16px              | 16px               | 20               | 24              |
| 14px              | 14px               | 17.5             | 21              |
| 12px              | 12px               | 15               | 18              |

## Principles of Usage

### Utilize components

Primer has many typographic solutions that have been created for developers and designers. Please refer to the docs to access them. Some of them include:

- [Alerts](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/alerts/)
- [Branch Name](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/branch-name/)
- [Labels](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/labels/)
- [Subheads](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/subhead/)
- [Navigation](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/navigation/)

### Usage:

Do not tailor your designs specifically around a certain typeface, as across interfaces and platforms they are subject to change. Because our font-stack defaults to system-fonts, it is important for designers to be aware of this fact when making design decisions.

Please refer to the [Typefaces](#Typefaces) section of this document to access our font-stack and resources.

### Best Practices:

**_Line length:_** Line length is important to consider when designing with body text in mind. It's considered good practice to keep lines around 80 characters or less. _Source_: [W3 Page Structure Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/styling/).

Cases vary depending on the situation, but this serves as a general rule of thumb for developing products at Github.

**_Type Consistency:_** Don’t overuse different type sizes, weights, and styling. Try to keep this to a minimum in order for an overall better reading experience for users. When possible, use type styling provided by Primer. Documentation for this can be found in Primer's [Typography Utilities](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/utilities/typography/).
