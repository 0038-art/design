# Typography

These guidelines summarize how we use typography at GitHub, and serve as guardrails for designers to design freely with best typographic practices in mind.

## Typefaces

At GitHub, our teams utilize system-fonts, which allow for optimized performance. This design decision takes advantage of retina screens, dynamic kerning, additional font-weights, and improved readability.

The most commonly used system-fonts are listed below. However, this isn’t a finite list, so keep in mind that typographic implementations may vary between browser settings and operating systems.

[Segoe UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/resources) for Windows

[San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for macOS and iOS

[Ubuntu](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/) for Linux (most commonly used of Linux distros)

## Font-Stack

**Default:**

```
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI",
Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
```

**Monospace:**

```
$mono-font: "SFMono-Regular", Consolas, "Liberation Mono", Menlo, Courier, monospace !default;
```

## Type Scale and Line-Height

| Font size: mobile | Font size: desktop | 1.25 line height | 1.5 line height |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 40px              | 48px               | 60               | 72              |
| 32px              | 40px               | 50               | 60              |
| 26px              | 32px               | 40               | 48              |
| 22px              | 24px               | 30               | 36              |
| 18px              | 20px               | 25               | 30              |
| 16px              | 16px               | 20               | 24              |
| 14px              | 14px               | 17.5             | 21              |
| 12px              | 12px               | 15               | 18              |

Our Marketing Typography Scale aligns with our core typography scale, except for one additional header size:

| Font size: mobile | Font size: desktop | 1.25 line height | 1.5 line height |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 48px              | 64px               | 80               | 96              |

## Principles of Usage

### Utilize components:

Primer has many typographic solutions that have been created for developers and designers. Please utilize them whenever possible, as they've been specifically designed to help individuals build GitHub products. Some of them include:

- [Alerts](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/alerts/)
- [Labels](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/labels/)
- [Subheads](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/subhead/)
- [Navigation](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/components/navigation/)

### Usage:

Do not tailor your designs specifically around a certain typeface, as across interfaces and platforms they are subject to change. Because our font-stack defaults to system-fonts, it is important for designers to be aware of this fact when making design decisions.

Please refer to the [Typefaces](#Typefaces) section of this document to access our font-stack and additional resources.

### Best Practices:

- **_Line length:_** Line length is important to consider when designing with body text in mind. It's considered good practice to keep lines around 80 characters or less—[W3 Page Structure Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/styling/). Cases vary depending on the situation, but this serves as a general rule of thumb for developing products at Github.

- **_Type Consistency:_** Don’t overuse different type sizes, weights, and styling. Try to keep this to a minimum for an overall better reading experience for users. When possible, use type styling provided by Primer. Documentation for this can be found in Primer's [Typography Utilities](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/utilities/typography/).
