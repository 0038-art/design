# Typography

These guidelines summarize how we use typography at Github, and serve as guardrails for designers to design freely with best practices in mind.

## Typefaces

At Github, our teams utilize system-fonts, which allow for optimized performance. This design decision takes advantage of:

- retina screens
- dynamic kerning
- additional font-weights
- improved readability
- operating system-agnostic design

[Segoe UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/resources) for Windows

[San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for macOS and iOS

[Ubuntu](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/) for Linux (most commonly used of Linux distros)

_Please keep in mind users have a very wide variety of typographic implementations. Conduct case-by-case research as the typefaces listed above are only generally what users use._

## Font Stack

```
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI",
Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
```

## Principles of Usage

### Utilize components

Primer has many typographic solutions that have been created for developers and designers. Please refer to the docs to access them
List of helpful components:

- subheads
- Label
- etc.

### Be aware of our usage of system-fonts:

Because Github font-stack defaults to system-fonts, it is important for designers to be aware of this fact when making design decisions. It’s recommended designers become familiar with typefaces themselves, and understand their nuances.

Please refer to the Typefaces section of this document to access our font-stack and resources.

### Best Practices:

#### _Line length:_

Line length is important to consider when designing with body text in mind. It's considered good practice to keep lines around 80 characters or less. _Source_:

Cases vary depending on the situation, but this serves as a general rule of thumb for developing products at Github

#### _Type Consistency:_

Don’t overuse different type sizes, weights, and styling. Try to keep this to a minimum in order to
