# Button Usage
These guidelines summarize how GitHub implements buttons across our products. We have standardized buttons documented on [Primer CSS](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/) and [Primer Components](https://primer.style/components), and these docs which serve as the source of truth for development implementation. This article serves to supplement our technical docs with proper guidance on design implementation.

#### Buttons

At GitHub, buttons are a fundamental building block of our products. The following table catalogues a quick glance at how we use buttons at GitHub: 

| Button | Visual | Usage | Notes | Modifiers |
| --- | ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Secondary | ![btn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52498774-86e4c200-2b8e-11e9-953b-e0e7a70493ea.png) | For secondary or less important actions | Should be considered as the go-to style when designing new buttons | Octicons, Size, Full-width, Button-Groups, Counter |
| Outline | ![btn-outline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52498769-864c2b80-2b8e-11e9-984a-d5b88c846b74.png) | For general actions, navigation, and filtering | Should be used independently and not in conjunction with other button styles | Octicons, Size, Full-width, Button-Groups, Counter |
| Primary | ![btn-primary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52498773-86e4c200-2b8e-11e9-804f-146d721d5191.png) | To indicate the primary action on a page or view | Avoid using multiple primary buttons in a single view | Octicons(limited), Size, Full-width |
| Danger | ![btn-danger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52498772-864c2b80-2b8e-11e9-8eeb-bef8729c1fd1.png) | To indicate potentially dangerous, or destructive actions | Only use this button when necessary | Octicons(limited), Size, Full-width|

## Usage

### Use Sentence Case


<Flex>
  <Box width='100%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='green.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52501276-d3330080-2b94-11e9-954e-38c0f09f8ca1.png"/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='green.5'>Do:</Text> Use sentence case 
  </Box>
  <Box width='100%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='red.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52501272-d3330080-2b94-11e9-8829-7d12aae36ba1.png"/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='red.5'>Don't:</Text> Use all-caps or other text formats
  </Box> 
</Flex>

### Keep Button Text Concise
When designing buttons, keep the text as short but descriptive as possible. Buttons are to be understood by their type and text; if further clarity is required, consider adding an octicon or adding a text description. 

### Adaptable Full-Width 
In certain scenarios, it may be appropriate for a button’s width to be extended to fill their parent container. Use this style sparingly, but some general, appropriate use-cases include:
- Modals with a singular call-to-action
- Responsive behavior of buttons when scaled down

<Flex>
  <Box width='100%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='green.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52501273-d3330080-2b94-11e9-906c-27d9f745f0c5.png"/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='green.5'>Do:</Text> Keep text brief, specific, and descriptive
  </Box>
  <Box width='100%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='red.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52501274-d3330080-2b94-11e9-823d-61964966cc7b.png"/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='red.5'>Don't:</Text> Use lengthy, wordy text and/or wrap it within the button
  </Box> 
</Flex>

### Text Descriptions
In certain scenarios, buttons require supporting text to give the user more context. Use text labels sparingly, as buttons should generally be able to be understood on their own.

<Flex>
  <Box width='50%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='green.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52501400-1b522300-2b95-11e9-8c47-71af68cfaeec.png"/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='green.5'>Do:</Text> Keep text brief, specific, and descriptive
  </Box> 
</Flex>

### Use Octicons to Clarify Actions
Use octicons in conjunction with buttons to clarify an action if text alone is not enough to explain its functionality. Octicons can also be used to signal an interaction, for example, the `triangle-down` octicon to open a dropdown.

Octicons can be used to call attention to the button’s action and make it stand out through consistent usage. For example, GitHub products use the repo icon in a button and then repeat its use throughout the "new repo" flow - this repetition and continuity is helps people learn our visual language. 

### Use Button Groups to Organize Similar Functionality  
Organize buttons together in button groups to show their similar functionality. Keep in mind that only default and outline buttons can be used as button groups. This modifier can also be used as a filtering pattern as well.

### Using Social Proof
Counters can be added to add a numerical aid in appropriate scenarios. They should generally only be used with “small” buttons, and only be used where a it is providing valuable context.


## Hierarchy and Placement

### Use Size to Modify Button Hierarchy
Increase button size to bring prominence to buttons that have major impact. Decrease button size when space is limited and the action is of lesser significance. Use this modifier sparingly, as layouts should generally have only one large button. 


### Limit Primary Button Usage
Only use one primary button on the page, whenever possible, to indicate its emphasis relative to other actions. Primary buttons have  top priority in visual hierarchy, and using too many of them on a single view dilutes their effectiveness.

### Always Align Primary Buttons to the Outermost Edge 
When a secondary button is placed in conjunction with a primary button, the primary button should always be placed on the outermost alignment, or on top and extended full-width if stacked.

<Flex>
  <Box width='100%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='green.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52501537-6ff59e00-2b95-11e9-9bac-f105481b9e21.png"/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='green.5'>Do:</Text> Follow this principle to align your buttons accordingly
  </Box> 
</Flex>

### Use Outline Buttons Independently
Outline buttons are mainly used for secondary actions such as filtering. Don't use in conjunction or place in close proximity of other button styles
