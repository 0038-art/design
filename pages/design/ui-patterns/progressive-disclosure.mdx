# Progressive Disclosure

These guidelines summarize how GitHub implements progressive disclosure—an interaction design pattern that hides/displays information. This article also contains information regarding guiding principles, best practices, and implementation support.

The following table outlines common progressive disclosure solutions in use at GitHub. For more in depth analysis and usage guidelines, please refer to Progressive Disclosure User Interface Patterns.

| Component | Icon | Usage | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chevron | ![chevron](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52089727-1ae9d480-2564-11e9-8291-1ee9d3225427.png) | When elements of content are collapsed and can be toggled open | Do not use this icon to trigger a dropdown menus or navigation; the Caret icon is the more suitable for this. | 
Expand/ Collapse Icon | ![expand](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52089724-1a513e00-2564-11e9-84f8-eba077f6abfc.png) | Signify that there is content (typically text) to be revealed | Should generally stand alone, rather than being paired with text | 
Ellipses Icon | ![ellipses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52089725-1ae9d480-2564-11e9-8d29-1dc28740924a.png) | For toggling truncated inline text content | Do not use this icon to trigger a dropdown menus or navigation; the Kebab icon is the more suitable for this. | 
Text-only Toggles | | | Usage of this solution is discouraged, as generally icons or icon+text pairings provide better accessibility and more information |
Kebab | ![kebab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52089726-1ae9d480-2564-11e9-984b-2d304cc0d46e.png) | N/A | Refrain from using this icon as a progressive disclosure solution |
Caret | ![caret](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52089723-1a513e00-2564-11e9-8179-420bba7922e7.png) | N/A | Refrain from using this icon as a progressive disclosure solution |


## Guiding Principles

### Maintain Context for Users
When designing interfaces that incorporate progressive disclosure, refrain from creating interactions that drastically disorient the user’s initial point of focus.

### Progressive Disclosure vs Navigation
It's important to understand the differentiation from progressive disclosure and navigation patterns, as the two share “cousin” elements that can be confusing when deciding which one to implement. 

Please refer to these guidelines as they detail in-use solutions, and outline best practices for implementation. For more clarity, refer to the Support section of this article for more information.

### Pair Icons with Text When Possible
Pair progressive disclosure icons with descriptive text to provide context.


### Implement Only as Necessary
Progressive disclosures should be used sparingly, when it’s necessary to truncate information for the general layout/design. 



## Progressive Disclosure UI Patterns

### Chevron Icon
The Chevron Icon is used when elements of content are collapsed and can be toggled open. Typically this icon is positioned vertically, and alternates between “up” and “down” states. This icon is quite flexible, and can stand alone, or be paired with text. 

<Text is='p' textAlign="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52079947-8a9f9580-254b-11e9-9e64-72a2a38f5ebd.png" />
  
  <p>Chevron icon used to display more branches in mobile view</p>
</Text>

<Flex>
  <Box width='100%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='green.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52088379-892c9800-2560-11e9-9296-7981780e1987.png"/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='green.5'>Do:</Text> utilize appropriate text in scenarios to provide clarity
   </Box>

 <Box width='100%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='red.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52088378-892c9800-2560-11e9-9e36-0e72599da28a.png"/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='red.5'>Don't:</Text> use the chevron to trigger dropdowns

  </Box>
</Flex>

#### Caution:
* The chevron should not be used as a call-to-action for drop down menus
* It should not be used for pagination, or indicate directional actions


### Fold/Unfold
This icon is used to signify that there is content that can be toggled open and closed. It is typically surrounded by text content above and below it. There are currently versions of this icon that expand the context in a singular direction, but are only used in GitHub’s code review editor.


<Text is='p' textAlign="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52089179-cdb93300-2562-11e9-846b-8f0b21b6b355.png" />
  <p>Fold/Unfold Icon used in Profiles context</p>
</Text>

<Flex>
  <Box width='100%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='green.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52090487-5b4a5200-2566-11e9-85ae-df25e1c5ecdc.png"/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='green.5'>Do:</Text> Use this icon to show content expansion in the code editor
   </Box>

 <Box width='100%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='red.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52090486-5b4a5200-2566-11e9-8f29-3c26f3787409.png"/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='red.5'>Don't:</Text>  pair this icon with lengthy text
  </Box>
</Flex>

#### Caution:
* This icon should generally be used to signify the expansion of text content
* Generally this icon does not displayed with accompanying text

### Ellipses Icon
The ellipses icon is used for toggling truncated inline text content. It’s primary purpose is to serve as a method that designers to use to curtail bodies of texts, but sometimes other types of information.

<Flex>
  <Box width='100%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='green.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52089514-8e3f1680-2563-11e9-9ca2-8b5f1c0f2a0b.png"/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='green.5'>Do:</Text> use this icon to give users the option to toggle the amount of text being displayed
   </Box>

 <Box width='100%' mr='2'>
    <BorderBox border='1px solid' borderColor='red.5' mb="2">
      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52089513-8e3f1680-2563-11e9-8d5d-e7db7815ab96.png "/>
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight='bold' color='red.5'>Don't:</Text> use this as a substitute for a Kebab icon
  </Box>
</Flex>

#### Caution:
* While visually similar, the ellipses icon is different from the kebab icon, which is used for dropdown menus or general call-to-actions. Be careful not to confuse them for one another. 
* This icon generally stands alone within inline bodies of text.

### Iterate and Componentize
If or when certain progressive disclosure patterns in your design emerge, or you believe a certain solution should be made into a component, reach out to the #design-systems channel on Slack to find out more on submitting your code or idea. You may also reach out by opening an issue to the team the team directly on Github.

### Requesting Feedback
Progressive Disclosure can be tricky to implement, and certain designs may test the bounds of our design guidelines in unique scenarios. If you have further questions or require clarity on implementation, please reach out to the  #design-systems channel on Slack.
