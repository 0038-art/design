# Blankslate
Blankslates are a great way to create cohesive and effective empty states. These guidelines will suggest ways to use the blankslate component and best practices. If you're looking for guidelines on implementation, please refer to [Primer CSS](https://primer.style/css/components/blankslate) or [Primer Components](https://primer.style/components).

## The Blankslate Component
The blankslate is made up of several elements that work together to inform the user about a feature and how to proceed forward. Below are the pieces of the component and guidelines on modifying them.

### Graphic
The graphic can bring delight, preview an interface element, or simply add color to balance the information of the component. There are a few variations to the graphic, which are outlined later on this page.

### Primary Text
This text will be the largest in the component and can make a user feel much more comfortable to engage. Primary text is meant to be welcoming and invitational. Text should sound human and convey the intention of the feature.

### Secondary Text
This optional text will be located below the primary text and should support informing the user about the feature. Secondary text should be brief and nonredundant if possible. Users should understand the general purpose of the feature and how it might help them accomplish a goal.

### Primary Action
Blankslates should contain at least one primary button. This button to lead to a feature or component creation flow. Button copy should be keep brief and descriptive. If a button requires further specification, consider adding an Octicon.

### Secondary Action
Secondary actions, if needed, should be located underneath the primary button in the form of a text link. These links typically lead to more information about the feature or component. This might look like "[Learn more about pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)" or "[Check out the guide on deploy keys](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/)".

### Border
The border is visible by default and helps define the structure of the blankslate component within the context of the page. It can be removed by adding `.border-o`.

## Variations
### Pictograms
Blankslates should default to using pictogram for graphic elements. Pictograms present a great preview of what should be in place of the empty state.

### Illustrations
Illustrations can be a great way to bring delight to an empty state. Illustrations should be used **sparingly** in empty states and only in cases where emotion is necessarily evoked from the user. For example, illustrations in a new user experience can help introduce octocats to the user and bring a more personalized experience.

## Content and Copy
Voice and language are important to making sure users are not only engaged, but also informed about features. Empty states should explain features in addition to conveying intention. Below is a good example of conveying intention in the primary text and using the secondary text to inform.
