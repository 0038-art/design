# Primer Design Guidelines

Documentation for UI patterns and interaction guidelines.

## Status
This is currently a work in progress! Follow along on our [project board](https://github.com/primer/design/projects/1).

## Local development

1. Clone this repo, e.g. with:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/primer/design
    ```

1. In the terminal, navigate (`cd`) to the repo directory

1. `npm install` to install dependencies

1. `npm run dev` to start the [Next] server

## Deployment

We deploy this site using [primer/deploy](https://github.com/primer/deploy). Every push to a branch other than `master` will deploy to a URL unique to the branch name, i.e.: `primer-design-{branch}.now.sh`. Merges to `master` will automatically deploy the site to `primer-design.now.sh`.
