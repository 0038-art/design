Onboarding is a virtual unboxing experience that helps users get started with an feature. This is a guide for designing onboarding for the product and does not include what to do for marketing pages, email announcements, social media, etc.

Check out the feature on-boarding Figma [sticker sheet](https://www.figma.com/file/FJtZyBeBfwDkByHPfDSN6k/Feature-onboarding?node-id=857%3A6).

When designing a feature onboarding flow, remember to:

- ✅ Think creatively utilizing different ways to onboard users, including patterns that are not explicitly mentioned in this document.
- ✅ Create a well-rounded feature release campaign that may leverage both on and off-product avenues.
- 🚫 Do not leave feature annoucement campaigns running forever.

## Guiding principles

### Proximity and proportion

- Onboarding elements should maintain an appropriate proximity to where the feature will live in perpetuity.
- Consider the primary job to be done on a page before disrupting the user with a feature callout. 
- Keep in mind the context, placement, and dominance of an onboarding element. 
- Onboarding UI choices should be proportional to the functional hierarchy of the feature on the page.

### Do not derail or trap the user

- Make it clear to the user how they may dismiss the message and return to their original task quickly.
- Maintain context if a call-to-action links to a new page, i.e. open the link a new tab or window to avoid losing a user's work.

### Set clear campaign limits

Create a new feature release timeline with clear parameters and an appropriate ramp down plan:

- **Define why**
  - System tiggers, e.g. a new feature released, a user should not need to dismiss the same annoucement each time they visit a different repository.
  - User triggers, e.g. a user visits a specific repository for the first time, if recurring, a user should feel added value each time they see the message.
  - Consider how triggers may be tallied for users who belong to multiple repositories and organizations.
- **Define when**
  - Timebox to a maximum number of days a coordinated campaign will run across all targeted users.
  - Specify a maximum number of impressions a user should see an in-product message. Respect when a user dismisses a message.

### Avoid traffic collisions

- Avoid showing too many alerts at the same time. Collisions are awkward and undesirable, no more than 2 alerts a time. 
- Consider what other alerts, teaching bubbles, or banners may be active on the page when crafting an onboarding experience.

### Create efficient sequences

Sequence tasks in a logical way to increase onboarding success. Clearly define when someone has started setup and successfully completed an onboarding flow. 

Treat feature onboarding as a story or a journey with a Beginning, Middle, and End:

#### Beginning: Draw attention to the feature

- Invite the user to engage with an onboarding journey.
- Use teaching bubbles, alert banners, the feature preview tray or annoucement modals to draw attention to the feature.

<Flex my={3}>
  <Box width="100%" mr="2">
    <BorderBox border="1px solid" borderColor="green.5" mb="2">

      <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6744014/89225996-0c80dc80-d590-11ea-9e08-b86b2022b7eb.png" />
    </BorderBox>
    <Text fontWeight="bold" color="green.5">
      Do:
    </Text> use teaching bubbles or other easily dismissable elements if users will discover the feature when they are completing another task.
  </Box>
</Flex>

#### Middle: Guide users through their task

- Use form, checklist, or other components to help users complete their task.

![Checklist example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47256527/88720479-c7fdc880-d0d9-11ea-9ac1-76b9defafe79.png)

#### End: Celebrate the finish

- Clearly define when someone has started setup and successfully completed an onboarding flow.
- Use a toast, flash alert, or other messages to confirm the user has completed their task. Message should be short and brief.

![Do](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47256527/88720500-d3e98a80-d0d9-11ea-8943-43e6e04431b3.png)

## Teaching bubble

A teaching bubble is a [Primer popover](https://primer.style/css/components/popover) that calls attention to a feature in a specific part of the page. Generally, teaching bubbles should be used to educate the user and enrich the task at hand.

### Usage guidelines

Teaching bubble Figma [sticker sheet](https://www.figma.com/file/FJtZyBeBfwDkByHPfDSN6k/Feature-onboarding?node-id=857%3A34). 

- ✅ **Do**
  - Highlight a new feature or important feature that extends or improves the user's experience on the page.
  - Show one teaching bubble at a time.
  - Include a headline that states the purpose of the message.
  - Keep messages short and concise, around 160 characters.
  - Make it clear how to easily dismiss the popover.
  - Include supplementary information when applicable. Consider a "Learn more" link in the message body that opens a new window or tab without destroying a user's work or context.
- 🚫 **Don't**
  - Do not point to hidden elements.
  - Do not use a teaching bubble if the user cannot immediately interact or benefit from the highlighted feature.
  - Do not derail users; call-to-actions should not remove the user from their current context.

## Inline feature discovery

Inline feature discovery is a way to highlight features without obscuring other parts of the page while a user may be performing an existing task. 

### Page banner

Page banners are used for annoucements that are relevant to the core task on the current page. Remember to consider using other feature announcement patterns or marketing strategies instead of disturbing the user with multiple announcements.

Include a clear way for users to dismiss a page banner and [clear campaign parameters](#set-clear-campaign-limits).

### Empty states

Use empty states as an integrated way to onboard users to new features. Read more about [empty states](/ui-patterns/empty-states).

**In-product marketing empty state**

For special occasions, a first time experience may be more unique than the typical blank state. Take a more branded approach to engage and guide the user through complex experiences. Be aware of how the experience will change once the first time UI is no longer there.

## Designated feature discovery areas

Designated feature area generally detached from where the feature actually lives and have a clear click through to try out the feature or learn more.

### Dashboard feature bulletin

The top of the right sidebar in a user’s dashabord (logged-in home) is a designated area for feature discovery. They take the user directly to the feature in the product or the relevant marketing pages.

When using a dashboard feature bulletin:

- Limit messages to around 160 characters. 
- If there is a click-through, include a descriptive button; avoid hidden links.
- Use color, with discretion, to spotlight and bring brand feature personality to the annoucement.

  <p>An annoucement about GitHub Teams in the feature preview bulletin leads to an off-platform marketing page.</p>
</Flex>

### Beta feature preview dialog

Feature previews allow teams to test features in production with users who opt in. A feature under the beta preview will be added to the Feature Preview dialog, accessible through the user dropdown

Please note, features in beta testing are strongly advised to have a comprehensive release and redaction plan. No feature should remain in beta for longer than 2 months unmonitored.

![Beta feature preview dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6744014/89245313-6b107f80-d5bd-11ea-86cb-b697c61a2d99.png)

## Flairs

Flairs is a softer way to accentuate new features without derailing the user from their primary task.

Consider using flairs for features that appear in a user’s current view but may navigate away from their current page to fully engage with the feature. They may also be applicable for smaller features that appear inline that are self-explainatory and do not need a teaching bubble. 

Include relevant links to capture feedback, marketing pages or changelog entries whenever possible.

See Primer documentation on [colored labels](https://primer.style/css/components/labels#colored-labels) and [muted links](https://primer.style/css/components/labels) for detailed implementation guidelines.
