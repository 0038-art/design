import {Box} from '@primer/react'

Primer includes three different messaging components:

- Announcement
- [Banner](../components/flash)
- [Popover](../components/popover)
- Toast
- Callout
- Inline message

## Message types

Messaging holds differing levels of prominence, which can be used to determine the appropriate component to use. Most messages fall into one of the following categories, from most prominent to least:

**System updates**: These types of message originate from GitHub and are not user initiated. A global site wide announcement (outage, missing payment details, critical and blocking) or messaging related to user account/permissions should use the **Announcement** component. System announcements related to a specific product area such as a single sign-on message should use the **Banner** component. System update type messages cannot be dismissed until the issue is resolved, or may be perminent if they are purely informative and not critical.

**Feedback**: Communicates the result of a user action (submitting a form, toggling a setting, etc.) Feedback can be positive, negative, or a warning. Feedback is shown in either a **Banner** or **Inline message**. For forms, an inline message is used for individual field validation which may be combined with a banner if multiple fields have errors. Banners are placed at the top of the page or section they are related to, but still within the body content. Inline messages are placed near the action they are related to.

**Awareness**: Communicates information that is relevant to the user but not necessarily related to an action they've taken. This type of message is typically used to provide context or additional information about a feature or product. A **Callout** might be used to suggest an action or helpful tip, while a **Popover** is typically used to announce a new feature.

## Message states

### Info
The info state should be used to provide additional information that when missed to not prevent users from performing their desired actions.
An info may be:
- a setting that impacts the current view
- a feature that is now available for you
- additional details about a section or action that are more important than normal

### Warning
The warning state should be used if a user action is required prevent a problem in the future. Additionally if information is provided that is very important so that missing this information may lead to unwanted consequences.
A warning can be:
- 2FA will be required soon and the users is not using it
- performing this action will have drastic effects e.g. deleting or archiving a repo, etc.
- performing an action will incur costs for the first time
- the system is experiencing temporary problems that impact the quality of service but do not make working completly impossible


### Error
The error state should be used if an error results from users input or in the systems (GitHub).
An error can be:
- invalid content in a form input
- a submitted action can't be performed due to an issue with the system
- content can't be loaded due to an issue with the system
- the users has insufficant permissions to access something
- the users needs to update information to be able to access the service (e.g. no 2FA set up, invalid billing details)

### Success
The success state should be used if a user action has a successful outcome.
A success can be:
- a complex valid form input value that needs outside confirmation (e.g. username or password creation)
- a saved content that can't be see in the UI
- connecting a service or enabling something that is not visible in the UI

## Placement (wip)

### Above global navigation

### Top of body

### Inline

### In a dialog

**System updates**: inform the user of errors or necessary updates or changes to the product as it relates to them.
_Announcement are best suited for this type of messaging._
Since annoucements are present on every page, they must only be used for global informations like an error that makes the entire web experience slow or the need to update your authentication method to avoid loosing access to your account.

Annoucements can not be dismissed, so they need to be removed once the cause for the annoucement is removed.

**Feedback**: communicates something to the user based on an action they've taken or caused
_Banners, toasts or inline messages are best suited for this type of messaging._
When the action was taken before loading a page and the message is present on page load, a banner should be used.
If the feedback is caused by an action on the current page, an inline message should be used when possible.
If the UI does not allow for inline messaging to be used, a toast can be used. However, you should try to avoid toasts for critical messages, as there are some issues with discoverability for some users.

Sometimes complex feedback is shown in a banner instead of an inline message to group mutliple lines together. A common example is a form error summary.

**Highlights**: bring attention to a specific section.
_Banners and callouts are best suited when highlighting information about a feature or form._
Banners should be used when highlighting information about important side-effects like incurring costs, permanently deleting content or removing access.
Callouts are used when providing additional details about an action.

To decide between banner and callout is important to analyse if the information is a side-effect or expected as part of the action. For when creating a `codespace` the action is the `codespace` being created while the side-effect are the costs. However when upgrading your plan, the costs are an expected part of the purchasing action.

## Toasts

[Toasts](https://primer.style/css/components/toasts) are used to provide relevant feedback to the user, typically after they've taken an action. Primer includes styles for success, warning, error, loading, and default toasts. Some examples include:

- Confirmation that an action was successfully taken
- Communicating that an action is pending
- Notifying the user if an action failed to complete
- Providing general information

Toasts are best used in context of the page they're referring to (rather than a global notification that can appear on any page) and should require minimal user interaction. Toasts are best used to display time-sensitive information. For global notices and messaging, see the [flash component](#flash-alerts).

Toasts should be brief and not bog down the experience with superfluous copy. If multiple toasts appear on the page, they will stack naturally.

    <Caption>Don't use wordy and redundant copy</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### Accessibility

Toasts are non-modal components and should contain `role=log`, which implies the element has `aria-live="polite"`. This notifies the user of the toast via Assistance Technologies without having to change focus to the toast. You can read more about `role=log` at [W3: Using `role=log` to identify sequential information updates](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA23).

Toasts are generally informative and should not receive focus when they appear. For that reason, we suggest you **avoid using interactive elements** in the component (aside from a dismiss action). Keep in mind that, even without an explicit dismiss action, the user can always hit `esc` to dismiss the toast. For more information on how interactive children affect web accessibility, [check out this issue](https://github.com/jackbsteinberg/std-toast/issues/29).

## Flash alerts

</Box>
Flash alerts are used to display updates or alerts pertaining to any part of the system; this includes information regarding
the user's account, the organization, the repo, and more. These updates are typically not user-initiated but rather alerts
that require the user's attention. Similarly to toasts, flash alerts can convey a warning, error, success, or a neutral message.

Though flash alerts don't need to be as concise as a typical Toast message, they should still be direct and not exceed two to three sentences. If additional context is needed, provide a link for the user to learn more.

Don't use headings or multiple type sizes in flash alerts, rely on our default paragraph size instead.

### Full-width

Flash alerts that affect every page (e.g. a global message) should use the [full-width style](https://primer.style/css/components/alerts), which spans the entire page and is intended to sit beneath the top-level navigation. When using a full-width flash alert, be sure to include the `container` class to append a max-width on the content and avoid long line-lengths, which can be difficult to read.

    <Caption>
      Don’t let a single text block span the entire width of the window (non-text elements can still span the entire
      width, such as left-aligned text and right-aligned buttons)
    </Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### Interactive elements

Flash alerts can contain links or buttons depending on the type CTA and how much attention it should draw.

They typically do not timeout on their own, but can include a dismiss action for messages that can be closed or hidden.

## Popovers

  </Box>
</Box>

Popovers are used to call attention to a new feature, change to an existing feature, or to provide additional context. Popovers can be helpful for flows that require light onboarding or instruction.

**Use sparingly to avoid cognitive overload**. Though they can be used for a variety of things, they should be used sparingly to avoid cognitive overload. It's important to consider the context in which the popover appears. Are there other popovers on the page? Does it appear on page load, or require the user to open the popover?

Unlike other messaging components, popovers should never include critical information (such as errors) and should always include a dismiss action.
