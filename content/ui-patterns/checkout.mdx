## Page types

### Full pages
Use full pages when you need to collect or confirm substantial user's information such as seats, billing, plan types, payment, etc. 
Full page experiences are great for confirming plan upgrades, as well as to review new sponsorships and marketplace app purchases.

Use cases:
- Upgrading to into a new plan.
- Buying licenses to a new product (example GitHub Advanced Security).
- Confirming and editing marketplace purchases.

### Light-weight checkout
Use dialog for checkout when you need to select items upon purchase without redirecting users to a new page. 

Dialog experience allows:
- Selecting an item to purchase and pay.
- Confirm amount to purchase and preview the price before making a final purchase.
- Manage the seats/licenses to purchase again for large amounts (list allow sorting).
- Error handling.

Use cases:
- Buying Copilot seats for organizations and enterprise.
- Users requesting additional seats.
