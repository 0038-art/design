title: Button usage

<!-- TODO: Change, too many words -->

These guidelines summarize how GitHub implements buttons across our products. We have standardized buttons documented on [Primer CSS](https://primer.style/css/) and [Primer Components](https://primer.style/components), and these docs which serve as the source of truth for development implementation. This article serves to supplement our technical docs with proper guidance on design implementation.

## Anatomy

### Keep button text concise

When designing buttons, keep the text as short but descriptive as possible. Buttons are to be understood by their type and text; if further clarity is required, consider adding an octicon or adding a text description.

### Adaptable full-width

In certain scenarios, it may make sense to use full-width buttons that extend to the width of their container. Use this style sparingly, but some appropriate use-cases include:

- Modals with a singular call-to-action
- Responsive behavior of buttons when scaled down

### Use text descriptions

In certain scenarios, buttons require supporting text to give the user more context. Use text labels sparingly, as buttons should generally be able to be understood on their own.

## Types and usage

<!-- TODO: Update images and add invisible button -->

### Primary

Use for the main action on a page or view. Use only one per page or view.

### Secondary

Use for general actions on the page or view.

### Outline

Use for important actions that you want to call attention to. Multiple outline buttons are allowed on a single page or view and also in conjunction with a primary button.

### Danger

Use for destructive actions or actions that will result in a negative outcome. Use danger buttons sparingly within a single page or view.

### Invisible

Use only paired with another button as the secondary action, such as the **Cancel** button in a form.

## Variations

### Icons

Use octicons in conjunction with buttons to clarify an action if text alone is not enough to explain its functionality. Octicons can also be used to signal an interaction, for example, the `triangle-down` octicon to open a dropdown.

In some cases, Octicons are used to create an identifiable visual indicator for a common action or paradigm. For example, the repo icon is used next to repo links, the new repo button, and repeated in the new repo flow. This repetition and continuity helps people learn and identify our visual language.

### Groups

Organize buttons together in button groups to show their similar functionality. Keep in mind that only default and outline buttons can be used as button groups. This modifier can also be used as a filtering pattern as well.

### Counters

Counters can be added as numerical aid in appropriate scenarios. They should generally only be used with “small” buttons, and only be used where it is providing valuable context.

## Hierarchy and placement

<!-- TODO: Can be a do/don't. Remove headings -->

<!-- ### Use size to modify button hierarchy -->

Increase button size to bring prominence to buttons that have major impact. Decrease button size when space is limited and the action is of lesser significance. Use this modifier sparingly, as layouts should generally have only one large button.

<!-- ### Always align primary buttons to the outermost edge -->

When a secondary button is placed in conjunction with a primary button, the primary button should always be placed on the outermost alignment, or on top and extended full-width if stacked.
