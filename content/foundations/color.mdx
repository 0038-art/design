   Color isa fundamental piece in the Primer visual language. In this guide you will learn about the principles, patterns, and abstractions that make Primerâ€™s color system.

## Get started
GitHub's UI offers a variety of different color modes. For product UI, design in light mode by default. Every pattern in Primer is built to work across all color modes out of the box.

## How to use color for product UI

Primer delivers colors in the form of [variables](https://primer.style/primitives/colors). Color variables can be grouped into different groups based on their purpose:

- Functional: To convey a meaning or a state. For example, from the functional perspective the color green is used to reinforce positive messaging. In a functional system green variables are named with the suffix `.success`
- Presentational: To represent a color. For example, the color steps in the Primer scale are named by color and lightness. Names are such as scale.blue.5. These variables don't currently support color modes. There is no available system to use colors in this form yet.

As the system grows, we are working to provide different APIs that fit different color needs. Check the [Primitives](https://github.com/primer/primitives/releases/tag/v7.2.0) repository to follow along as we release new variables and systems.

### Functional color system
The functional system is based on the meaning, or purpose, that colors have in the interface. This system is estructured into two groups of variables:

- Foundations: Foregrounds, backgrounds and borders that make 95% of a product interface. Each variable is generated based on visual weight. 
- Color roles: Foregrounds, backgrounds and borders to highlight affordance or meaning of elements in the UI.

### Why use the Primer functional system

 - âœ… I need dark, dimmed, etc mode
 - âœ… I want to get all future themes updated for free
 - âœ… I want to guarantee I have an accessible color answer across themes

### Foregrounds: Text and icons
Foreground elements are text and icons. You can apply color to them using any of the foreground (or `fg` for short) variables. 

**Foundations**
[IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual list of foundations foreground colors: default, muted and on-emphasis]

- `Default`: Primary color for text and icons in any given interface. It should be used for body content, titles and labels. 
- `Muted`: Use for content that is secondary or provides additional context but is not critical to understanding the flow of an interface.
- `On emphasis`: On emphasis is the text color designed to combine with -emphasis backgrounds for optimal contrast.

**Color roles**
[IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual list of color roles foreground colors: accent, success, attention, severe, danger and done]

- `fg.accent`: Use for links [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- `fg.success`: Use to emphasize a positive message [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- `fg.attention`: Use to flag text or icons that require the users attention [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- `fg.danger`: Use to emphasize an error or a blocking status. Action is required [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- `fg.severe`: Use to emphasize a level of severity between attention and danger [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- `fg.done`: Use to style text that refers to completed tasks or workflows [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]

<img width="480" alt="img-color-roles-example" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6951037/141304173-5f919074-b5ae-4c0b-b5d2-8a2cd6ea2d03.png" />

### Backgrounds
Background colors affect surfaces of components or UI elements, such as pages, boxes, and overlays.

**Foundations**

- `bg.default`: Primary background color. 
- `bg.subtle`: Provide visual rest and contrast against the default background.
- `bg.emphasis`: Itâ€™s highest in contrast against the default background, such as in tooltips. 
- `bg.inset`: Can be used instead of default background when you want to create a focal point like in conversations or activity feeds.

**Color roles**

- `bg.accent`: Use to accentuate interactive areas in the UI like selected elements. [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- `bg.success`: Use to highlight a positive message. [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- `bg.attention`: Use to highlight elements that require a users attention or pending statuses. [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- `bg.danger`: Use to emphasize an error or a blocking status. Action is required [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- `bg.severe`: Use to emphasize an extra level of severity between attention and danger [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- `bg.done`: Use to style text that refers to completed tasks or workflows [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]

-Emphasis: Every background has an `.emphasis` variant. These backgrounds are reserved to reinforce the highest priority element in a single page or view. [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]

### Borders
Borders can be used to group content or to create a visible separation between sections or items. Theyâ€™re most commonly used on tables, side sections, and cards. 

**Foundations**
- Default: Use to create bounds around content, for example elements inside a card. Default borders are critical to understanding a page layout.
- Muted: Use for dividers to emphasize the separation between items, columns or sections. 

**Color roles**

- `border.accent`: 
- `border.success`: 
- `border.attention`: 
- `border.danger`: 
- `border.severe`:  
- `border.done`:

### Combining Colors
Not all colors pair well with each other. There are combinations of backgrounds and foregrounds that guarantee compliance with WCAG contrast guidelines and a wide range of hierarchical relationships between elements.

### Presentational color system (ðŸ”’only accessible to GitHub staff)
We are working on a system to apply color to labels and other user-defined components. Itâ€™s currently in the design stage. If you have any suggestions or questions about this project, please add a comment to the issue. https://github.com/github/primer/issues/287

### Data visualization color system (ðŸ”’only accessible to GitHub staff)
Primer does not currently have a data visualization system. In the meantime, weâ€™ll try to offer support on a case-by-case basis, prioritizing customer needs. If you have any questions about data visualization, open an issue [here].
