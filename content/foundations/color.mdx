   Color is one of the fundamental pieces of the Primer visual language. In this guide you will learn about the principles, patterns, and abstractions that make Primerâ€™s color system.

## Get started
GitHub's UI can be rendered in a variety of different color modes. Every element on GitHubâ€™s interface maps to a color in the scale for each color mode.

- Primer supports multiple color themes. Design in light mode by default, for product UI. 
- **If youâ€™re using the color system to build UI:** These docs are intended to help you navigate the color system with guidelines and color tools:

## Principles
The Primer color system is designed with some principles in mind that may help you make decisions on how to use color.

### Use color with purpose
For a visual language to be effective, it needs to be as clear and concise as possible. Some ways you can apply this principle. For example, in product UI avoid using color for decoration. 

### Color is accessible by default
Colors can help some users scan UI elements. Some other users may find it easier to scan elements that have different shapes, sizes or space around them. Never use colors on their own to convey a meaning. Color should be used as a supporting element to reinforce a message or a status. 

## How to use color for product UI

Primer delivers colors in the form of [variables](https://primer.style/primitives/colors). These color variables are classified based on the *job* they have in the product interface. Color jobs can be:

- Functional: Convey a meaning or a state. For example, [add quick example].
- Presentational: Convey the color value. For example, in user-created labels or categories.

Each of these jobs is controlled by a different system with its own rules, requirements, and conventions.

### Why use Primer color systems

 - âœ… I need dark, dimmed, etc mode
 - âœ… I want to get all future themes updated for free
 - âœ… I want to guarantee I have an accessible color answer across themes

### Functional color system
The functional system is based on the meaning, or function, that colors have in the interface. For example: the color blue is not called blue, itâ€™s called accent. Its purpose is to highlight interactive elements.

### Foregrounds: Text and icons
Foreground elements are text and icons. You can apply color to them using any of the foreground (or `fg` for short) variables. 

**Foundations**
[IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual list of foundations foreground colors: default, muted and on-emphasis]

- `Default`: Primary color for text and icons in any given interface. It should be used for body content, titles and labels. 
- `Muted`: Use for content that is secondary or provides additional context but is not critical to understanding the flow of an interface.
- `On emphasis`: On emphasis is the text color designed to combine with -emphasis backgrounds for optimal contrast.

**Color roles**
[IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual list of color roles foreground colors: accent, success, attention, severe, danger and done]

- Accent: Use `fg.accent` for links [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- Success: Use `fg.success` to emphasize a positive message [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- Attention: Use `fg.attention` to flag text or icons that require the users attention [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- Danger: Use `fg.danger` to emphasize an error or a blocking status. Action is required [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- Severe: Use `fg.severe` to emphasize a level of severity between attention and danger [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- Done: Use `fg.done` to style text that refers to completed tasks or workflows [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]

<img width="480" alt="img-color-roles-example" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6951037/141304173-5f919074-b5ae-4c0b-b5d2-8a2cd6ea2d03.png" />

### Backgrounds
Background colors affect surfaces of components or UI elements, such as pages, boxes, and overlays.

**Foundations**

- `Default`: Primary background color. 
- `Subtle`: Provide visual rest and contrast against the default background.
- `Emphasis`: Itâ€™s highest in contrast against the default background, such as in tooltips. 
- `Inset`: Can be used instead of default background when you want to create a focal point like in conversations or activity feeds.

**Color roles**

- Accent: Use `bg.accent` to accentuate interactive areas in the UI like selected elements. [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- Success: Use `bg.success` to highlight a positive message. [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- Attention: Use `bg.attention` to highlight elements that require a users attention or pending statuses. [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- Danger: Use `bg.danger` to emphasize an error or a blocking status. Action is required [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- Severe: Use `bg.severe` to emphasize an extra level of severity between attention and danger [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]
- Done: Use `bg.done` to style text that refers to completed tasks or workflows [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]

-Emphasis: Every background has an `.emphasis` variant. These backgrounds are reserved to reinforce the highest priority element in a single page or view. [IMG ðŸŒ‡ alt: Visual example]

### Borders
Borders can be used to group content or to create a visible separation between sections or items. Theyâ€™re most commonly used on tables, side sections, and cards. 

**Foundations**
- Default: Use to create bounds around content, for example elements inside a card. Default borders are critical to understanding a page layout.
- Muted: Use for dividers to emphasize the separation between items, columns or sections. 

**Color roles**

- `border.accent`: 
- `border.success`: 
- `border.attention`: 
- `border.danger`: 
- `border.severe`:  
- `border.done`:

### Combining Colors
Not all colors pair well with each other. There are combinations of backgrounds and foregrounds that guarantee compliance with WCAG contrast guidelines and a wide range of hierarchical relationships between elements.

Presentational color system (ðŸ”’only accessible to GitHub staff)
We are working on a system to apply color to labels and other user-defined components. Itâ€™s currently in the design stage. If you have any suggestions or questions about this project, please add a comment to the issue. https://github.com/github/primer/issues/287
Data visualization color system (ðŸ”’only accessible to GitHub staff)
Primer does not currently have a data visualization system. In the meantime, weâ€™ll try to offer support on a case-by-case basis, prioritizing customer needs. If you have any questions about data visualization, open an issue [here].
