These guidelines are specific to and focused on GitHub product interfaces. Your first port of call for general content guidelines should be [GitHub’s Content Style Guide](https://brand.github.com/content/), followed by the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

## UI content principles

Keep the following principles in mind when creating UI content for GitHub.

### 1. Keep it clear
Aim for a seventh-grade or below reading level. This means you should write text that is straightforward, without trying to be creative with words.

There are some useful tools you can use to test your content for simplicity and reading level:
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
- [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
- [Automatic Readability Checker](https://www.readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php)

### 2. Keep it consistent
Refer to the same actions, sections, labels, landing pages, and so on, the same way across the product. But don’t sacrifice clarity over consistency.

## Voice and tone
GitHub’s voice is:
- Clear but not cold
- Conversational but not jargon-y
- Inclusive but not disingenuous
- Helpful but not overly-prescriptive

Tone is how you express personality and mood depending on the situation. GitHub’s tone is almost always **informal and positive**, with adjustments when needed depending on the channel, audience, and emotional state of the audience.

You should consider the context of when a user will read something, keeping in mind that: 
- Humor isn’t welcome in all situations, for example: in errors, when waiting, or when something fails.
- Error messages should be understandable by humans.

Read more about GitHub’s voice and tone in the [Brand Guide](https://brand.github.com/content/voice).

## Top 10 rules
If you’re in a hurry, these are the most important content guidelines to keep in mind, in no particular order.

- Write in plain English, don’t sound like a robot.
- Be brief, remove unnecessary words like adjectives and adverbs.
- Use active voice.
- Use sentence case, and when in doubt, don’t capitalize.
- Always capitalize GitHub correctly.
- Avoid gendered language.
- Do not use slang or culturally-specific references.
- Do not use “here” or “click here” in calls to action.
- Be very thoughtful when introducing humor to the interface.
- Have someone else proofread your text.

## Content guidelines

### Acronyms and abbreviations
Use acronyms when they are more widely used than the spelled out term.
 
“Pull request” should never be abbreviated. It’s always lowercase unless it’s starting a sentence.

<!-- TODO: Where do we abbreviate? Months -->

<!--
### Alternative text
TODO: In which cases should the UI include alternative text that doesn’t come for free with Primer.

Do not replace text with emojis.
-->

### Dates and time 
When referring to times, use am and pm, and not any other variation (a.m., A.M., AM).

<!-- TODO: Dates. -->

### Emojis
Avoid using emojis, but when you do:
- Use them only at the end of a sentence
- Use only well-recognized emojis
- Do not repeat emojis
- Use emojis that will work well in both dark and light modes

<!-- See also alternative text. -->

### Error messages
Be friendly and helpful, and avoid jargon. Do not blame the user.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Enter a name</Text>  
  <Text fontSize={3}>Your name must be between 2 and 20 characters</Text>
 </Do>
 <Dont>
  <Text fontSize={3}>You forgot to add a name</Text>    
  <Text fontSize={3}>Error 1234567890</Text> 
 </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

Be specific.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Enter a credit card number</Text>   
 </Do>
 <Dont>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Field required</Text>    
 </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

In most cases, apologizing won't fix the problem. As a rule, do not apologize too much in any situation in the UI.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>All checks failed</Text>   
 </Do>
 <Dont>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Sorry, all checks failed</Text>    
 </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

Do not try to be funny or humorous.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Some checks failed</Text>   
 </Do>
 <Dont>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Oops, some checks failed</Text>    
 </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### Feedback 
Feedback should be clear and reassuring, using the same terms used by the UI elements that triggered it. Don't try to be funny, and avoid jargon.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Issue transfer in progress</Text>   
  <Caption>Feedback message when transferring an issue, using the same term ("transfer") as the trigger button</Caption>
 </Do>
 <Dont>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Moving the issue</Text>    
  <Caption>Feedback message that uses a different term ("moving") than the trigger button</Caption>
 </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

<!-- TODO: More confirmation messages. Save, close, dismiss. -->

### Forms
Use sentence case for form titles, labels, and fields.
Do not include colons in form labels.

<!-- TODO: Error messages, form validation examples. -->

### Labels and buttons
All labels and button text should be in sentence case, and not include punctuation.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Save email preferences</Text>
  <Text fontSize={3}>1 linked pull request</Text>
  <Text fontSize={3}>12 days ago</Text>    
 </Do>
 <Dont>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Save email preferences.</Text>
  <Text fontSize={3}>1 Linked pull request</Text>
  <Text fontSize={3}>12 Days ago</Text>    
 </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

<Note>When a sentence or label starts with a number (for example, “2 references”), the number is the first word, and the rest of the sentence should be in lowercase.</Note>

Action labels should start with an imperative verb that clearly indicates what to expect.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Save preferences</Text>
 </Do>
</DoDontContainer>

Action labels can be shortened to only include an adjective and a noun.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>New issue</Text>
 </Do>
</DoDontContainer>

Use “sign in” rather than “log in”.

### Links
Link text should be meaningful and unique, with as few duplicated references as possible to prevent confusion. Ideally the link itself, or, alternatively, its programmatically determined context, should provide information about where the link will take you, and help users decide whether to follow the link. Examples of programmatically determined context can be aria labels, or text within the same paragraph as the link.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>You can find out more about our speakers at the GitHub Universe site”</Text>
  <Caption>Set the context within the paragraph.</Caption>
 </Do>
</DoDontContainer>

<DoDontContainer>
  <Do>
    <Code className="language-html">
      {`<a href="/pricing">
   <img src="pricing.jpg" alt="">
   Pricing information
</a>`}
    </Code>
    <Caption>Set the context of the image link from the text within the same container.</Caption>
 </Do>
</DoDontContainer>

Never say “here” or “click here”.

<!--
### Numbers
TODO: Commas, truncation, rounding up or down. Do units have a space, KB, MB, etc.?
-->

### Punctuation
Headings, labels and buttons should not include punctuation. In most cases, exclamation marks are not appropriate — most things aren't _that_ exciting.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>No code scanning alerts found</Text>
 </Do>
 <Dont>
  <Text fontSize={3}>No code scanning alerts found!</Text>
 </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### References to UI
When referring to unclickable page names and sections, write them as they appear in the interface in quotation marks.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Go to the “Email notification settings” section.</Text>
 </Do>
</DoDontContainer>

When referring to button or link text that a user should click on, use bold text without quotation marks. Make sure all UI references match the capitalization in the interface. If you’re writing for a mobile app experience, use “tap”, instead of “click”.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Click <strong>Save</strong></Text>
 </Do>
</DoDontContainer>

When referring to a folder, use a code tag.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Open the <code>docs</code> folder.</Text>
 </Do>
</DoDontContainer>

### Subject
In most instances, address the user as "you" and items "owned" by the user as "your" or "yours".

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Update your profile</Text>
 </Do>
 <Dont>
  <Text fontSize={3}>Update my profile</Text>
 </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

Some exceptions exist and are usually related to legal language, such as when a user needs to agree to terms, or confirm a destructive action.

<DoDontContainer>
 <Do>
  <Text fontSize={3}>"I have read the Terms of Service"</Text>
  <Text fontSize={3}>"I understand, convert this issue to a discussion"</Text>
 </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

<!--
### Text truncation
TODO: Examples of truncation: dates, large numbers, long file names.
-->

## What to avoid
- Do not say that something is “easy”, “quick”, or that the user “just” needs to do something.
- Do not capitalize common terms. Only proper nouns and product names should be capitalized.
- Do not use emoji in UI content, or to replace words.
- Use the word “and” instead of an ampersand or the “+” sign.
- Do not use exclamation marks to indicate excitement, most actions aren’t.
- Do not use the greater than and less than symbols to indicate steps in a flow.
- Do not use semicolons: they are hard to get right and can be replaced by a period most times.
