## Overview

Overlays can streamline the interface by allowing extra options to be displayed as needed. Overlays present a new context to the user, and can facilitate the completion of individual tasks. They are also useful for data-manipulation, providing a dedicated surface for selecting or editing options.

**Keep overlays simple**. Overlays are meant to be interacted with quickly, so they're better suited for clear experiences. Avoid creating a whole page inside an overlay. Prefer single-column layouts that convey a clear goal the moment it's opened.

**Overlays can be fully interacted with a keyboard**. Keyboard navigation should be limited to the elements of the active overlay. If the overlay contains a list, let users navigate using keyboard arrows. Pressing Escape should dismiss the overlay. When an overlay is dismissed, focus generally returns to the element that opened it.

**Overlay contents should work well on any device**. Overlays may adapt to bottom sheets or full-screen on mobile devices. Make sure the overlay contents work with all supported sizes and input methods.


## Anatomy

Overlays may include a header to provide context, and footer to host actions. Its main area can support any content inside, and it may be scrollabe. For interactive lists, use [Action lists](/components/action-list).

Overlays have a **safe area** of 16px. This is not a strict padding, but a guide to let the overlay boundaries free of text and heavy visual elements. Interactive elements may still be 8px away from the edge, as long as their main visual elements are within the safe area. For example, the **Close** button has its padding outside the safe area, but its octicon is distant enough.

</ImageContainer>

### Overlay header

An overlay header may be used to provide context to the user by displaying title, description, and offering an easy-to-escape route with a **Close** button. Overlay headers may also provide ways for the user to interact with items through search and tabs.

Avoid using a description if the title already conveys the same information. Don't be verbose.

Reserve confirmation actions such as **Save**, **Apply**, and **Done** to the overlay footer, not the header.

A divider between the header and content area is optional if there's no overflow scrolling.

### Overlay footer

Use an overlay footer to show confirmation actions, navigation links or other important elements that should appear at the bottom. Footers are shown outside of the scrolling area, and are always visible to the user.

A divider between the footer and content area is optional if there's no overflow scrolling.

## Behaviors

### Opening

Overlays appear in the page after a direct user interaction, i.e. on click, tap, press, etc.

On desktops and other devices with a fine pointer, overlays may also be triggered by a delayed `hover` event (GitHub calls these _hovercards_). Since this behavior doesn't work on touch devices, consider whether tapping on the source element should open the overlay or take the user to its destination directly. For example, a delayed hover on a **@username** may present a _hovercard_ on desktop, while a tap on the username would open a bottom sheet with a link to the user's profile page.

Don't show overlays on page load. For that, prefer in-page messages and flash banners.


### Closing

Users may always click outside or press Escape to close an overlay. Some overlays may provide a close button as an easy escape route. They're useful in larger overlays, and when the overlay is no longer visually connected to the source that triggered them. Always use close buttons in dialogs.

Closing an overlay may apply changes right away (as seen in selection panels). If the overlay contains changes that are not immediately applied (such as in a form), offer footer buttons such as **Save**, **Apply**, or **Done**. If the user closes the overlay without saving, offer a [`beforeUnload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeunload) prompt to the browser so the user can avoid losing changes. The same confirmation should appear if the user tries to close the browser tab.

The user should also be able to press the browser's back button to close the overlay. This is particularly useful on mobile devices.


### Width and height

Width | Size
----|----
`sm` | 256px
`md` | 320px
`lg` | 480px
`xl` | 640px
`xxl` | 960px

Height | Size
----|----
`auto` | Adjusts to content height
`xs` | 192px
`sm` | 256px
`md` | 320px
`lg` | 432px
`xl` | 600px

## Placement

Overlays may be:

- Anchored next a source element (popovers).
- Centered on a container or on the viewport with a backdrop (dialogs).

On smaller screens, overlays can be one of the options above, or adapt to mobile-specific variations. There, they may:

- Appear as a bottom sheet (anchored to the bottom of the screen for easier reachability).
- Appear full-screen (for forms, long lists and other complex flows).

### Anchored overlays as popovers

Anchored overlays can be used in any device or screen size. They anchor to the button or source element that triggered them, drawing a direct connection between the elements. The source element should have a "selected" visual state while the overlay is opened.

Anchored overlays are useful for menus, quick interactions, and data manipulation. They don't dim the rest of the screen when presented. 

Interaction with the rest of the screen is temporarily blocked while an anchored overlay is active. They can be dismissed at any time by clicking outside of it. An anchored overlay may also be dismissed after choosing one of its options or buttons, or when clicking on an optional Close button.

        style="background: none"
    />
</ImageContainer>
<Caption>An anchored overlay attached to its source.</Caption>

Keep anchored overlays out of the viewport edges. They should be at least 16px away from the viewport boundaries. Users shouldn't be blocked from scrolling the page while an anchored overlay is open, nor should a scrolling event in the page close the overlay.

For more complex overlays, consider enabling mobile-specific bottom sheet or full-screen variations.

Primer React uses [`anchoredPosition`](https://primer.style/components/anchoredPosition) to calculate the position of an anchored or centered overlay:

<ImageContainer>

    width="508"
    src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/293280/126408752-c40d6f55-3790-45e7-9ea6-529c702154da.png"
    alt=" "
    style="background: none"
  />
</ImageContainer>
<Caption>

Source elements (purple squares) and their overlays (white squares) with  `side` (`outside-top`, `outside-right`, `outside-bottom`, `outside-left`) and `align` (`start`, `center`, `end`) settings.

</Caption>

### Centered overlays as dialogs

Dialogs appear centered in the page, with a visible backdrop that dims the rest of the window for focus.

All dialogs should have a title and a close button. Use an overlay header to compose these required elements.

Dialogs are modal. Dialogs can be dismissed by clicking on the close button, or by interacting with another button in the overlay. To avoid losing information and missing important messages, clicking outside of the dialog will not close it. Prevent page scrolling when a dialog is visible.

Make sure larger dialogs remain mobile-friendly. Even large dialogs need to be responsive. A dialog's width and height will be readjusted depending on the screen size and should never exceed the available space. Use responsive solutions to adjust the UI so they behave well on smaller screens.

Dialogs never hit the viewport edges. Use a safe 32px margin to keep dialogs visually distinct from the rest of the page.

Simple and small dialogs can remain as-is on mobile. As more elements are added to it, mobile-specific style variations such as Bottom sheet and Full-screen should be considered.

  />
</ImageContainer>
<Caption>

</Caption>

### Bottom sheets (specific to small screens)

A bottom sheet is a mobile-friendly and mobile-specific placement option. Overlays that appear anchored or centered in large screens may adapt to appear as a bottom sheet on small screens.

A bottom sheet variant can be used when the overlay content is too overwhelming to appear anchored, or to faciliate reachability. A bottom sheet dims the rest of the screen for focus. This provides additional emphasis on its content and actions. Tapping on the backdrop dismisses the overlay.

A bottom sheet has rounded upper corners. Its height should always accommodate the content inside.

<img
    src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/293280/126387985-8c14aaf9-6b63-4ead-b466-520f3156cb1a.png"
    alt=" "
    style="background: none"
/>

In order to work well in non-rectangular mobile screens and browser UI, bottom sheets may add extra padding inside the overlay, following [`env(safe-area-inset-*)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env()) environment variables.

On portrait, a bottom sheet takes up the full-width.

On landscape, a bottom sheet has a maximum width of 480px, centered horizontally.

<ImageContainer>

        width="880"
        src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/293280/126532776-fb9efd1c-1c98-4345-817e-46a269863850.png"

    alt=" "
    style="background: none"
/>
<Caption>Indicator when no title and close button are present.</Caption>

A bottom sheet without a title or close button gets an indicator at the top. In case the bottom sheet gets long and takes all the available height, the indicator will reserve a safe area to keep the overlay dismissable.
