## Overview

Overlays can streamline the interface by allowing extra options to be displayed as needed. Overlays present a new context to the user, and can facilitate the completion of individual tasks.

**Keep overlays simple**. Overlays are meant to be interacted with quickly, so they're better suited for focused experiences. Avoid creating a whole page inside an overlay. Prefer single-column layouts that convey a clear goal the moment it's opened.

**Overlays are often used for data manipulation**. Overlays can appear on top of the screen to let the user select and edit content in a way that was previously not available. Ensure these interactions are quick and effective.

**Overlays can be fully interacted with a keyboard**. Keyboard navigation should be limited to the elements of the active overlay. If the overlay contains a list, let users navigate using keyboard arrows. Pressing Escape should dismiss the overlay. When an overlay is dismissed, focus generally returns to the element that opened it.

**Overlay contents should work well on any device**. Overlays may transform into bottom sheets or full-screen experiences on mobile devices. Make sure the experience takes into account devices of all sizes and input methods.


## Anatomy

An overlay may include a header to provide content, and a footer to provide actions.

    alt="Overlay anatomy"
    style="background: none"
  />
</ImageContainer>

### Overlay header

An overlay header appears at the top of an overlay. It may introduce its content with title, description, and general actions.

Avoid using a description if the title already conveys the same information. Don't be verbose.

Reserve confirmation actions such as **Save**, **Apply**, and **Done** to the overlay footer, not the header.

A divider between the header and content area is optional if there's no overflow scrolling.

  />
</ImageContainer>

### Overlay footer

Use an overlay footer to show confirmation actions, navigation links or other important elements that should appear at the bottom. Footers are shown outside of the scrolling area, and are always visible to the user.

A divider between the footer and content area is optional if there's no overflow scrolling.

## Behaviors

### Closing

Users may always click outside or press Escape to close an overlay. Some overlays may provide a close button as an easy escape route. They're useful in larger overlays, and when the overlay is no longer visually connected to the source that triggered them. Always use close buttons in dialogs.

Closing an overlay may apply changes right away (as seen in selection panels). If the overlay contains changes that are not immediately applied (such as in a form), offer footer buttons such as **Save**, **Apply**, or **Done**. If the user closes the overlay without saving, offer a [`beforeUnload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeunload) prompt to the browser so the user can avoid losing changes. The same confirmation should appear if the user tries to close the browser tab.

The user should also be able to press the browser's back button to close the overlay. This is particularly useful on mobile devices.


### Width and height

Width | Size
----|----
`sm` | 256px
`md` | 320px
`lg` | 480px
`xl` | 640px
`xxl` | 960px

Height | Size
----|----
`auto` | Adjusts to content height
`xs` | 192px
`sm` | 256px
`md` | 320px
`lg` | 432px
`xl` | 600px

## Placement

Overlays may be:

- Anchored to a source element (also known as a popover).
- Centered on a container or on the viewport (also known as a dialog).
- Placed full-screen, when on small viewports.
- Placed as a bottom sheet, when on small viewports.

### Anchored overlays (popovers)

Anchored overlays are useful for menus, quick interactions, and data manipulation. They attach to the button or element that triggered the overlay, drawing a direct connection between them. The source element should have a "selected" visual state while the overlay is opened.

Simple menus and other smaller anchored overlays may be displayed as-is on smaller screens (smaller than `md` breakpoint). As the overlay gets larger and more complex, a bottom sheet may provide more dinstinction and context.

        <Box as="p">Use an `arrow-right` octicon in menus to indicate the action will open more options, such as in a nested context. Use an `edit` octicon to indicate the item is going to be edited after clicking it.</Box>

        <Box as="p">When using a trailing text for displaying keyboard shortcuts, always confirm the characters match with the user's operating system.

## Specialized overlays

Several specialized components that rely on overlays are available for use. Use them directly when aiming for a specific behavior:

<Grid gridTemplateColumns={['1fr', null, null, null, '1fr 2fr']} gridGap={4}>
    <div>
        <Link href="/components/action-menu">
            <img alt="Action menu" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/293280/123880964-95b3a700-d8f8-11eb-9775-cbaf165207ed.png" />
        </Link>
    </div>
    <div>
        <Link href="/components/action-menu" fontWeight="bold">Action menu</Link>
        <Box as="p">Action menus are used for disambiguation, navigation, or to display secondary options. They appear when users interact with buttons, actions, or other controls.</Box>
    </div>
    <div>
        <Link href="/components/dropdown-menu">
            <img alt="Select panel" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/293280/123881067-cdbaea00-d8f8-11eb-98e4-e57c64489308.png" />
        </Link>
    </div>
    <div>
        <Link href="/components/dropdown-menu" fontWeight="bold">Dropdown menu</Link>
        <Box as="p">Dropdown menus are used for making a single selection among a small list of options. The list is usually predefined with system values, but in some cases it can include user-provided data when those are known not to grow into too many items.</Box>
    </div>
    <div>
        <Link href="/components/select-panel">
            <img alt="Select panel" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/293280/123876997-4158f900-d8f1-11eb-85cb-461d9bbee0cb.png" />
