## Usage
Links enable users to navigate between pages or resources in a seamless way. Links can be used within a body of text or as a standalone element.

Links are user interface elements that navigate you to a new place or new content. Do not use links for triggering an action. Instead, use buttons, which are designed to activate a feature.

Links should be concise and not exceed more than a few words.

## Anatomy

The link component can be displayed as `default`, `muted`, or `blue` colors, can be underlined, may include a leading visual or trailing visual, and can be either the `default` or `small` size.
