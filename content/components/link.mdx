## Usage
Links enable users to navigate between pages or resources in a seamless way. Links can be used within a body of text or as a standalone element.

Links navigate you to a new place or new content. **Do not** use links for triggering an action. Instead, use [buttons](/components/button), which are designed to activate a feature.

Links should be concise and not exceed more than a few words.

## Anatomy

The link component can be displayed in `default`, `muted`, or `blue` colors, can be underlined, may include a leading visual or trailing visual, and can be either the `default` or `small` size.
