title: Dialog

A dialog is a type of overlay that can be used for confirming actions, asking for disambiguation, and presenting small forms. It allows to focus on a quick task without having to navigate to a different page.

## Anatomy

## Usage guidelines

Dialogs appear in the page after a direct user interaction. Don't show dialogs on page load or as system alerts.

Dialogs appear centered in the page, with a visible backdrop that dims the rest of the window for focus.

All dialogs should have a title and a close button. Use an overlay header to compose these required elements.

Dialogs are modal. Dialogs can be dismissed by clicking on the close button, or by interacting with another button in the overlay. To avoid losing information and missing important messages, clicking outside of the dialog will not close it. Prevent page scrolling when a dialog is visible.

Make sure larger dialogs remain mobile-friendly. Even large dialogs need to be responsive. A dialog's width and height will be readjusted depending on the screen size and should never exceed the available space. Use responsive solutions to adjust the UI so they behave well on smaller screens.

Dialogs never hit the viewport edges. Use a safe 32px margin to keep dialogs visually distinct from the rest of the page. 

Simple and small dialogs can remain as-is on mobile. As more elements are added to it, mobile-specific style variations such as Bottom sheet and Full-screen should be considered.
