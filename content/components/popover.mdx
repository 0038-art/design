## Usage

<Grid gridTemplateColumns={['1fr', null, null, null, '1fr 1fr']} gridGap={4}>
    <div>
        <Flex bg="gray.1" justifyContent="center">
            <img width="400" alt="" src="https://compai.pub/v1/png/41d55c2894e91bd7d0594d005ce51e2471292973343c01dcbbc271c34aa2d702"/>
        </Flex>
    </div>
    <div>
        <Flex>
            Popovers don't dim the rest of the screen to separate the content presentation from the rest of the screen.
        </Flex>
    </div>
    <div>
        <Flex bg="gray.1" justifyContent="center">
            <img width="400" alt="" src="https://compai.pub/v1/png/41d55c2894e91bd7d0594d005ce51e2471292973343c01dcbbc271c34aa2d702"/>

            Interaction with the rest of the screen is temporarily blocked while a popover is active. A popover can be dismissed by clicking anywhere outside of it. A popover can also be dismissed after selecting an option inside of it, or clicking on an optional Close button.

            A popover is the overlay type for menus, for listing actions, for selecting one or multiple items. A popover can have overlay headers, action lists, and overlay footers. Popovers can also support any custom content inside them.

        <Flex bg="gray.1" justifyContent="center">
            <img width="400" alt="" src="https://compai.pub/v1/png/41d55c2894e91bd7d0594d005ce51e2471292973343c01dcbbc271c34aa2d702"/>

            Simple and small popovers can remain as-is on mobile. As more elements are added to it, mobile-specific style variations such as **bottom sheet** and **full-screen** should be considered.

## Positioning

<img alt="Popover positioning" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/223966/118826339-50409a80-b8b3-11eb-9512-e407cf361d94.png" />

- A popover is always positioned in relation to its source, by default set as `outside bottom start`. If the popover doesn't fit the available screen size, it tries to reposition itself so it's visible to the user while remaining anchored to the source.
- Keep popovers out of the viewport edges. Popovers should be at least 16px away from the viewport boundaries. (as long as the source anchoring allows it)
- Popovers can be positioned `outside` or `inside` the source area, placing them respectively next to or on top of the source. Placing the popover on top of the source can be useful when it contains editable data.
