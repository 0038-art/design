title: General guidelines
---

For official guidance, coming back to W3C should be the ultimate source. Quickly find techniques for fixing and failure examples for each WCAG standard in the [How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference) ](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.1&showtechniques=148&currentsidebar=%23col_customize#visual-presentation). The filtering on the left hand side is very helpful to scan for specifics like, developing, interaction design, content creation, visual design categories, and more. 

## Visual considerations

### Color
(insert photo of our colors with pass/fail)
For information about how GitHub is achieving use of color and color contrast guidelines, check out the accessibility section under our guidelines for color (Link to be added).

Note: Disabled controls do not need to hit any specific contrast levels. 

**Official WCAG rules**
[1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum)(Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
[1.4.11 - Non-text Contrast (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html)[1.4.1 - Use of color (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html)

### Typography
#### Use headings
(insert photo of proper headings, labeled)
Make sure that paragraphs and sections have approriate headings. This makes it easier for visual scanning and screen readers to get a map of the page's content. Use the semantic structure for headings whenever possible (`h1`- `h6`)

#### Length of text
Though a AAA guideline and not a requirement to meet government standards, try to hit these typography standards if possible for better ease of reading:
- Width of text should not exceed 80 characters or glyphs 
- Don't justify text
- Allow for text magnification up to 200% without requiring horizontal scrolling.

For specifics on the typography that GitHub utilizes, visit our [Typography](https://primer.style/design/foundations/typography) resource in our interface guidelines.

#### Links
Navigating from a list of all the links on a given web page is very common for assistive technology users. Make sure that the link text itself is meaningful and unique. There should be as few duplicated references as possible to prevent confusion.

#### Do
```html
<p>Find out more about <a href="#url">GitHub Enterprise pricing</a>.<br /></p>
```
#### Don't
```html

</p>
```

### Forms
(Would like to remove this section and just put it in our forms area)
- All form inputs need labels
- Don't use placeholder text for any titles, hints, or other important information. 

### Alt-text
When people with screen readers come across images, graphs, and icons, by default the screen reader will speak the name of the file, which most of the time can be unhelpful (eg; final-final-truly-final-V2.jpg). 

Use the `alt="string"` attribute when labeling an image. If the image has a descriptive caption already, you should give the image an atttibute of `alt=""`. This will prevent the screenreader from telling the person about the image multiple times. 

## Semantic markup
Always use semantic HTML elements, like `button`, `ul`, `nav`. Most modern browsers implement the accessibility features outlined in the specs for these elements; without them, elements will need additional [ARIA attributes and roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/) to be recognized by assistive technologies.

Elements like `h1`-`h6`, `nav`, `footer`, `header` have [meaningful roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#role_definitions) assigned, so use them, and use them carefully. This can help assistive technologies read the page better and help users find information quicker.

Only use a `div` or a `span` to markup up content when there isn't another HTML element that would semantically be more appropriate, or when an element is needed exclusively for applying CSS styles or JS behaviors.

### Do
```html
<button type="button" class="btn">Send</button>
```

### Don't
```html
<span class="btn">Send</span>
```

## Keyboard accessibility
Make sure all interactive elements can be accessed using Tab and Shift+Tab, and the arrow keys. Tabbing should be used to access standalone controls (buttons, links, widgets), and arrow keys should be used to navigate within a composite control (group of standalone controls, list of checkboxes)

Tab order is determined by the order of elements in the DOM, and not by their visual positioning on the page after CSS is applied. CSS properties float and order for flex items are two common sources for disconnection between visual and DOM order.

The `tabindex` attribute should only be used when absolutely necessary.

- `tabindex=0/-1` makes an element focusable, while tabindex=0 also includes the element in the normal tab order. In both cases, keyboard triggers of the element still require scripting, so where possible, use [interactive content](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#interactive-content) instead.

- `tabindex=1+` takes an element to the very front of the default tab order. When it's applied, the element's visual positioning is no longer indicative of its tab order, and the only way to find out where an element is would be by tabbing through the page. Therefore, unless a page is carefully designed around elements with positive tabindex, it is very error-proned, and thus currently prohibited in github.com.

Finally, bear in mind that some assistive technologies have keyboard combinations of their own that will override the combination on the web page, so don't rely on keyboard shortcuts as the only alternative to mouse actions.

- The UK Government designed [easy-to-read posters](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/blob/master/accessibility/dos-donts/posters_en-UK/accessibility-posters-set.pdf) on designing for accessibility, broken out into principles for various conditions. Here is an [article about the posters](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/) they designed.
- The [a11yproject](https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/#html-and-aria) has collected a wealth of resources on web accessibility. We recommend browsing first by the table of contents on the side, as the list of resources is quite long.

### Pattern libraries
- [Inclusive components](https://inclusive-components.design/)
- [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/) is an in-depth list of UI patterns and how to implement them, from W3C. 
- [a11ymatters patterns](https://www.a11ymatters.com/patterns) - shorter list, good information for developers.

## Screen readers
Getting familiar with screen reader technology will allow you to get a better understanding of the people who navigate the web this way, and it will help you to check out your own UI to verify that it's usable. 

**Top three screen readers for computers** ([data from WebAIM](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/), August 2019)
- NVDA (Windows)
- JAWS (Windows)
- VoiceOver (Mac)

**Top three screen readers for mobile devices** ([data from WebAIM](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/), August 2019)
- VoiceOver (iOS)
- TalkBack for Android (Android)
- Voice Assistant (Android)

Keep in mind that behaviors in different screen readers can differ when navigating the same web page; just like designing for different browsers, when it comes to accessibility, it is not just the implementation of the browsers that can be different, but also the ones of assistive technology.
