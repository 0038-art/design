## Visual considerations
### Color
Text ***must*** meet a minimum contrast level against its background.
- 14pt (regular weight) must hit a contrast level of 4.5:1. 
	- 14pt is around 19px for most screens
- 18pt (regular weight) or 14pt (bold) must hit a contrast level 3:1.
	- 18pt is around 24px for more screens

Anything that's not text, but provides crucial

### Dos and Don'ts on designing for accessibility
The UK Government designed [easy-to-read posters](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/blob/master/accessibility/dos-donts/posters_en-UK/accessibility-posters-set.pdf) on designing for accessibility, broken out into principles for various conditions. Here is an [article about the posters](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/) they designed.
### Pattern libraries

## Screen readers
**Top three screen readers for computers** ([data from WebAIM](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/), August 2019)
- NVDA (Windows)
- JAWS (Windows)
- VoiceOver (Mac)

**Top three screen readers for mobile devices** ([data from WebAIM](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/), August 2019)
- VoiceOver (iOS)
- TalkBack for Android (Android)
- Voice Assistant (Android)

Keep in mind that behaviors in different screen readers can differ when navigating the same web page; just like designing for different browsers, when it comes to accessibility, it is not just the implementation of the browsers that can be different, but also the ones of assistive softwares.
