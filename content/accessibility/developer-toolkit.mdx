## General guidelines
### Semantic markup
Always use semantic HTML elements, like `button`, `ul`, `nav`. Most modern browsers implement the accessibility features outlined in the specs for these elements; without them, elements will need additional [ARIA attributes and roles](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) to be recognized by assistive technologies.

Elements like `h1`-`h6`, `nav`, `footer`, `header` have [meaningful roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions) assigned, so use them, and use them carefully. This can help assistive technologies read the page better and help users find information quicker.

Only use a `div` or a `span` to markup up content when there isn't another HTML element that would semantically be more appropriate, or when an element is needed exclusively for applying CSS styles or JS behaviors.

`<!-- Do: Button can be focused and tabbed to. -->` \
`<button type="button" class="btn">Send</button>`

`<!-- Don't: Button can't be focused and tabbed to. -->` \
`<span class="btn">Send</span>`

## Linting
We currently run basic linting [against positive tabindex](https://github.com/github/github/blob/8546895623677abc70f61951642f32c16de231a1/test/fast/linting/accessible_tabindex_test.rb) and [anchor links with href="#"](https://github.com/github/github/blob/8546895623677abc70f61951642f32c16de231a1/test/rubocop/cop/rails/link_href.rb).

We do client side scanning of inaccessible elements in development environment. The inaccessible elements will be styled with red borders with an onclick alert and console warnings.

**Would like to add something about Accessibility Insights fastpass for CI/CD**

## External tools
- [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io) - Accessibility Insights is a Chrome and Edge extension. 
	- **FastPass** - Automated checks and tab stops allow you to catch the most common accessibility issues in less than 5 minutes. Errors are highlighted on the webpage.
	- **Assessment** - An assisted manual process to catch everything in WCAG 2.1 on the webpage.
	- **AdHoc** - various tools to check for things like meaning in color, landmarks, headings, etc.
