A great way to find answers to specific accessibility questions is to do an online search for the component/issue in question + 'a11y', 'accessible', or 'accessibility', and scan for official websites like W3C ([https://w3.org](https://w3.org)).

## Accessibility Insights
One of the best things a developer can do is learn by doing, and the same goes for developing accessibly. 

A very key learning and accountability tool is [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/). 

Any time a developer creates a new or changed user-facing experience, Accessibility Insights should be run on the site or component to catch any accessibility errors. 

### FastPass
Within FastPass mode you have two tests to run.

- Automated checks scans your webpage for the most common accessibility errors, gives detailed location information, and helpful how to fix tips.
	- You can file bugs/issues right from each of the accessibility errors.

- Tab stops gives you a visual of the focus order on your webpage. It is not automated, you must tab through the page manually to get the visuals added.

After running these tests you can export a report to share the status of the webpage.

### Assessment

Assessment is a manual but guided set of tests that covers all of WCAG 2.1 guidance. Because this can take some time, there is local storage for saving progress, and an overview page to help you keep track of progress. 

You can print out an exported report of your assessment results at any time while testing.

### AdHoc
![Screenshot of AdHoc testing feature in Accessibility Insights](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40274682/89365128-d4a99000-d688-11ea-9db5-c29cb4a55075.png)
AdHoc includes five overlay tests:

- Automated checks (same test within each mode)
- Landmarks
- Color
- Tab stops (same test within FastPass)
- Headings

![Screenshot of the helpful how to test information for the AdHoc tests on Accessibility Insights](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40274682/89365012-9f9d3d80-d688-11ea-8f26-bc918a20e34b.png)

Each section has a link on understanding how to test, dos and don'ts, and best practices.

## The A11y project
[The A11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/#learn-the-fundamentals-and-principles-behind-accessible-design) is a resource containing helpful blog posts, a [manual checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) to navigate, and a plethora of other [helpful resources](https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/). The resources list is long, so we recommend navigating via the table of contents, or searching the page with CMD+F for specific inquiries.
