There are many accessibility checklists out there that you can use while developing UI to make sure your code is as accessible as possible. Below are a few that we recommend.

## Accessibility Insights
As with most development topics, incorporating accessibility into your workflow is better learnt by doing. This tool provides the guidance needed to learn how to catch accessibility problems in your own code.  

A helpful learning and accountability tool is [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/). Any time you create a new or changed user-facing experience, run Accessibility Insights on the site or component to catch any accessibility errors.

There are three different modes you can access to test in Accessibility Insights for Web, depending on the depth of testing needed: FastPass, Assessment, and AdHoc.

### FastPass
Within FastPass mode you have two tests to run.

- **Automated checks** scans the page for the most common accessibility errors, gives detailed location information, and helpful how to fix tips.
	- You can file bugs/issues right from each of the accessibility errors.

- **Tab stops** gives you a visual of the focus order on the page. It's not automated â€” you must tab through the page manually to get the visuals added.

After running these tests you can export a report to share the status of the page.

### Assessment

Assessment is a manual but guided set of tests that covers all of WCAG 2.1 guidance. Because this can take some time, there is local storage for saving progress, and an overview page to help you keep track of progress. 

You can print out an exported report of the assessment results at any time while testing.

### AdHoc
![""](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40274682/89365128-d4a99000-d688-11ea-9db5-c29cb4a55075.png)
AdHoc includes five overlay tests:

- Automated checks (same test within each mode)
- Landmarks
- Color
- Tab stops (same test within FastPass)
- Headings

Each section has a link on understanding how to test, dos and don'ts, and best practices.

## Accessibility guide for developers
An official site of the United States government, their [front-end development](https://accessibility.digital.gov/front-end/getting-started/) section provides a general walkthrough of standards to meet for hitting WCAG 2.0 on government websites. Because it only reaches WCAG 2.0, there are WCAG 2.1 specific guidelines that are missing, but overall it gives a good picture of content categories to think about while developing accessibly. 

## The A11y project
[The A11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/#learn-the-fundamentals-and-principles-behind-accessible-design) is a resource containing helpful blog posts, a [manual accessibility checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/), and a plethora of other [resources](https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/). The resources list is long, so we recommend navigating via the table of contents, or searching the page with CMD+F for specific queries. 

## a11y portal
[Another manual a11y checklist](https://www.a11yportal.com/guidelines/fundamentals/checklists.html#custom-control-checklist-developer), specifically for custom control creation.

We recommend familiarizing yourself with the items in this checklist and using them as a resource when authoring new code. As always, the best source of truth for the last accessibility guidelines can be found on the [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/). 

## Searching the internet
A great way to find answers to very specific accessibility questions when a resource is unavaiable, is to do an online search for the component/issue in question + 'a11y', 'accessible', or 'accessibility', and scan for official websites like W3C ([https://w3.org](https://w3.org)). 

Many of those searches will lead you to the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/) and [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/)

## Linting
We currently run basic linting [against positive `tabindex`](https://github.com/github/github/blob/8546895623677abc70f61951642f32c16de231a1/test/fast/linting/accessible_tabindex_test.rb) and [anchor links with `href="#"`](https://github.com/github/github/blob/8546895623677abc70f61951642f32c16de231a1/test/rubocop/cop/rails/link_href.rb).

We do client side scanning of inaccessible elements in development environment. The inaccessible elements will be styled with red borders with an onclick alert and console warnings.

## Internal resources
- #accessibility channel in Slack
- Microsoft's design system, Fluent, has an accessibility channel in Teams. TThis channel is dedicated to making the Fluent design system accessible, but is home to many talented designers and developers passionate about accessibility.
