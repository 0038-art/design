We don't have to tackle accessibility alone. Many designers and developers have created tools to aid us in aiding others. 
## Checklists
### Component creation
### UX Flow
## Figma 
### Sticker sheet
Accessibility markers to label your Figma file for developer hand-off. Stickers to label tab order, roles  labels, and announcement types for notifications. 
### Focus order, Tabindex, Tab order, Tab stops plugins

- [A11y - Focus Orderer](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731310036968334777/A11y---Focus-Orderer) - Select your elements in the desired tabbing order, add them to the plugin to get a visible layer label, and use the tab key to test the tab order right inside of Figma.
	- **How does this help?** - Instead of manually placing tab order stickers on your design, let the plugin do it for you, and you can tab through your design to see if the flow makes sense.

### Color contrast plugins
One of the most well-known accessibility spaces for designers, check your color contrast without leaving Figma.

- [A11y - Color Contrast Checker](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733159460536249875/A11y---Color-Contrast-Checker) - Select two frames to check contrast between them. You'll get the contrast ratio, it'll show the pass/fail for A, AA, and AAA, and you can adjust the lightness right within the plugin and see results real-time.

- [Able - Friction free accessibility](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/734693888346260052/Able-%E2%80%93-Friction-free-accessibility) - This is similar to A11y - Color Contrast Checker. The layout is a bit different and it's a matter of personal preference.

- [Contrast](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/748533339900865323/Contrast) - This plugin does the same as the above in addition to checking accessibility on top of gradients.

## Tools on the computer

- [Sim Daltonism](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sim-daltonism/id693112260?mt=12) - Free application in the Mac App Store that can simulate various color blindness disorders.
	- **How does this help?** - When we are designing something that uses color (yes, that's everything), we can use this app to see what we've designed through the eyes of those who have color blindness and see if it makes sense to them.

## Tools on the web
### Color contrast checkers (can't have too many!)

/Contrast Checker.png

-[WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) - manually paste hex codes to get their contrast ratio and see if it passes or fails for normal text, large text, and graphical objects

/The contrast between.png

- [Color Review](https://color.review/) - Color review is fantastic if you're looking for help in finding an accessible color in a current palette with less guesswork. 

### Full site accessibility

/Automated checks.png

- [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io) - Perfect assistant for live webpages. Perform a quick automated pass, test your Tab stops, Landmarks, Headings, and even an assisted manual walkthrough to hit all of WCAG 2.1 guidance. Walking through the Assessment on any webpage can help you get acquainted with WCAG guidelines.
