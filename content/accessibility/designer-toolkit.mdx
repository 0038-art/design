We don't have to tackle accessibility alone. Many designers and developers have created tools to aid us in aiding others. 
## Checklists
### Component creation
- [ ] Keyboard operable
- [ ] Expected operation
- [ ] Clear indication of focus
- [ ] Color contrast
- [ ] Label
- [ ] Role 
- [ ] States and properties
### UX Flow
- [ ] Annotation labels for developer handoff
	- [ ] Focus/Tab order
	- [ ] Screen reader labels
	- [ ] Headings
	- [ ] Landmarks (if applicable)
- [ ] Text meets color contrast (4.5:1 or 3:1 ratio depending on size) Link to color
- [ ] Graphic objects meet color contrast (3:1 ratio) Link to color
- [ ] With color removed, does the design still make sense?
- [ ] If someone increases the text size, is the page still usable? 
## Figma 
### Sticker sheet
Accessibility markers to label your Figma file for developer hand-off. Stickers to label tab order, roles  labels, and announcement types for notifications. 
### Focus order, Tabindex, Tab order, Tab stops plugins

- [A11y - Focus Orderer](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731310036968334777/A11y---Focus-Orderer) - Select your elements in the desired tabbing order, add them to the plugin to get a visible layer label, and use the tab key to test the tab order right inside of Figma.
	- **How does this help?** - Instead of manually placing tab order stickers on your design, let the plugin do it for you, and you can tab through your design to see if the flow makes sense.

### Color contrast plugins
One of the most well-known accessibility spaces for designers, check your color contrast without leaving Figma.

- [A11y - Color Contrast Checker](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733159460536249875/A11y---Color-Contrast-Checker) - Select two frames to check contrast between them. You'll get the contrast ratio, it'll show the pass/fail for A, AA, and AAA, and you can adjust the lightness right within the plugin and see results real-time.

![Able - Friction free acessibility plugin screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40274682/88444655-fece9880-cdd2-11ea-9af2-be6b6d1fe08e.png)

- [Able - Friction free accessibility](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/734693888346260052/Able-%E2%80%93-Friction-free-accessibility) - This is similar to A11y - Color Contrast Checker. The layout is a bit different and it's a matter of personal preference. 

![Contrast plugin screenshots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40274682/88444681-1c036700-cdd3-11ea-9be2-92eb651419d3.png)

- [Contrast](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/748533339900865323/Contrast) - This plugin does the same as the above in addition to checking accessibility on top of gradients.

## Tools on the computer

![Sim Daltonism app screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40274682/88444732-5ff66c00-cdd3-11ea-97f6-350c2f5a6f32.png)

- [Sim Daltonism](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sim-daltonism/id693112260?mt=12) - Free application in the Mac App Store that can simulate various color blindness disorders.
	- **How does this help?** - When we are designing something that uses color (yes, that's everything), we can use this app to see what we've designed through the eyes of those who have color blindness and see if it makes sense to them.

## Tools on the web
### Color contrast checkers (can't have too many!)
