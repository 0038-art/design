A collection of tools to help product designers design accessibly. 

Whether you’re designing a new user experience or just one component, make sure you’re addressing the considerations from the respective list.

## Accessibility checklists

### New or updated feature
If you're designing a feature or experience in GitHub, use this checklist below to assess your design for accessibility before developer hand-off.

- [ ] Annotation labels for developer handoff
  - [ ] Headings
  - [ ] Focus/Tab order
  - [ ] Screen reader labels
  - [ ] Landmarks (if applicable)
- [ ] Text meets color contrast (4.5:1 or 3:1 ratio depending on size)
- [ ] Graphic objects meet color contrast (3:1 ratio)
- [ ] With color removed, does the design still make sense?
- [ ] If someone increases the text size, is the page still usable? 
- [ ] Reflow of screen to smaller sizes (down to 320px wide), is everything usable without scrolling horizontally? (few exceptions to this rule. Check out [1.4.10 - Reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) for details)

Properly labeled headings is one of the most important things a designer can label for developer handoff. [68% of 1207 surveyed users](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/) responded that they are first likely to navigate through the headings on the page when trying to find information on a length web page.

### Interactive control creation
If you're designing a new component or control for GitHub that will not be made up of one single piece of [standard semantic markup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element), check out the Accessibility Portal's [custom control design checklist](https://www.a11yportal.com/guidelines/fundamentals/checklists.html#custom-control-checklist-ux).

## Figma 

### Accessibility sticker sheet
This [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/o3Vhxw4SmBsUjeaVq3nF4y/Accessibility-Notation?node-id=0%3A1) includes annotations to use on your designs prior to developer-hand off. These annotations let you note accessibility information like desired tab order, screen reader labels, headings, and landmarks. Pull directly from the file or turn on the accessibility annotations in your Figma assets list.

### Tab stop/Swipe stop plugin

- [A11y - Focus Orderer](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731310036968334777/A11y---Focus-Orderer): Select your elements in the desired tabbing order, add them to the plugin to get a visible layer label, and use the tab key to test the tab order right inside of Figma. 
  - **How does this help?** Instead of manually placing tab order stickers on your design, let the plugin do it for you, and you can tab through your design to see if the flow makes sense.

### Color contrast plugin
Checking the color contrast is one of the most important steps to take as a designer. Thankfully there are plugins for Figma that allow you to check without leaving the design tool. 

- [Contrast](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/748533339900865323/Contrast): This plugin will check contrast of text, graphical objects, and even gradients.

## System tools

- [Sim Daltonism](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sim-daltonism/id693112260?mt=12): Free application in the Mac App Store that can simulate various color blindness disorders.
	- **How does this help?** When we are designing something that uses color (yes, that's everything), we can use this app to see what we've designed through the eyes of those who have color blindness and see if it makes sense to them.

## Web tools
### Color contrast checker

- [Color Review](https://color.review/) - Color review is fantastic if you're looking for help in finding an accessible color in a current palette with less guesswork.
