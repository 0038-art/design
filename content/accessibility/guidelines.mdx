For official guidance, always refer to the [WCAG 2.1 W3C documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). You can find failure examples for each WCAG standard, and techniques for fixing them in [How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.1&showtechniques=148&currentsidebar=%23col_customize#visual-presentation). 

## It starts with you
Accessible experiences start with designers. Tacking on accessibility after a design has been implemented not only costs businesses time and money, but it muddies the original design and leads to poor user experiences for both people with and without disabilities. 

When we consider accessibility at the start, we can begin to design for everyone. 

Consider how different people will experience your design. For an informative list on real-life disability situations, check [An Alphabet of Accessibility Issues](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anne-gibson/2014-july-31), published in The Pastry Box Project.

## Feature checklist
If you're designing a feature or experience in GitHub, use the following checklist to assess your design for accessibility:
- [ ]  Annotations:
    - [ ]  Headings
    - [ ]  Focus/Tab order
    - [ ]  Screen reader labels
    - [ ]  Landmarks (if applicable)
- [ ]  Does the text meet color contrast?
- [ ]  Do graphic objects meet color contrast?
- [ ]  With color removed, can you still understand the design?
- [ ]  Can all revealable information (hover card, tooltips, accordions) be accessed with a keyboard or a mouse?
- [ ]  If the user increases the text size to 200%, is the page still usable?
- [ ]  When the screen reduces in size (down to 320px wide), is everything usable without scrolling horizontally? (There are a few exceptions to this rule: check  [1.4.10 - Reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) for details)

## Basic visual considerations
WCAG 2.1 includes more nuanced considerations than what is listed here, but these basic considerations will give you a strong foothold into accessible design.
### Color
#### Contrast
Text and user interface components on a page must meet a specific minimum contrast ratio to pass WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- **Why?** People with low vision may have trouble reading or understanding important information. Depending on the contrast ratio, users may not see the item at all. Besides being perceived as disabled, this makes people struggle with things like making sure they select the correct option.

       <Caption>Buttons with sufficient text contrast</Caption>
    </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

**Normal text** (14pt)
4.5:1 minimum
**Large text** (14pt bold + , 18pt +)
3:1 minimum
**Graphical objects and user interface components**
3:1 minimum

**Note:** Disabled controls do not need to hit any specific contrast levels.

**Official WCAG guidelines**
- [1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum)(Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
- [1.4.11 - Non-text Contrast (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html)
- [1.4.1 - Use of color (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html)

#### Use of color
Adding in color brings delight to user experiences. The key point in [1.4.1 Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html) is to make sure that it's not the sole identifier. If you have an important transition that is only a change in color, make sure that color change has a 3:1 contrast ratio. 

A great way to test for this is to navigate your designed experience in greyscale mode.

### Typography
#### Headings
Properly labeled headings are one of the most important things a designer can make sure to do for developer handoff. [68% of 1207 surveyed screen reader users](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/) responded that they are first likely to navigate via the headings when trying to find information on a lengthy web page.

Use the semantic structure for headings whenever possible on paragraphs and sections (`h1`-`h6`). 

There should only be one `h1` per web page. (Markdown on a page is an exception)

**Note:** Headings on a page don't need to visually match the semantic hierarchy, but should take on the appropriate role. 
- **Why?** This makes it easier for visual scanning and screen readers to get a map of the page's content.

       <Caption>Don't use multiple H1s, skip over heading hierarchy for visual effect, or forget to label sections of information with headings</Caption>
    </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

#### Links
Assistive technology users will frequently browse a list of links for easy navigation. For this reason, make sure that the link text is meaningful and unique. There should be as few duplicated references as possible to prevent confusion.

For more detail on accessible links, read the W3C's [Understanding 2.4.4 - Link Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context.html).

    <Code className="language-html">
      {`<p>
  Find out more about <a href="#url">GitHub Enterprise pricing</a>.<br />
</p>`}
    </Code>
    <Caption>Make links meaningful and easy to understand</Caption>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <Code className="language-html">
      {`<p>

  <a href="#url">click here</a>.
</p>`}
    </Code>
    <Caption>Don't create links that give no indication to the user</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

#### Forms
- All form inputs should have a visible label
- Don't use placeholder text for titles, hints, or other important information.

    - **Why?** Visible labels determine the purpose for inputs, and screen readers can read this information without extra code. If placeholder text contains important information and that information disappears when one starts to type, those with cognitive disabilities will have difficulty completing the form.

#### Alt-text
Use HTML the alt attribute when labeling an image. If the image has a descriptive caption already, you should give the image an attribute of `alt=""`. This will prevent the screenreader from telling the user about the image multiple times.
 - **Why?** When screen readers come across images, graphs, and icons, by default the screen reader will speak the name of the file, which most of the time can be unhelpful (for example: `final-final-truly-final-V2.jpg`).

#### Content hover on focus
Hover cards and tool tips need to be approached with care. To meet the bare minimum for accessibility, tooltips need to be: 
- **Dismissible**
    - Be able to dismiss tooltips without moving the pointer or keyboard focus (unless it's an input error or does not cover other content)
- **Hoverable**
    - Pointer can move over the hover content without the content disappearing
- **Persistent**
    - The tooltip doesn't dismiss itself without user action.

For more information, [1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html) 

#### Text
People using the web should be able to increase font size 200% without losing content or functionality.

If you'd like to take the extra mile and meet non-required AAA guidelines, you can apply these:
- Width of text should not exceed 80 characters or glyphs 
- Don't justify text (align text to the left and right)

Read Primer's [typography](https://primer.style/design/foundations/typography) guidelines for more detail about using type on GitHub.

## Keyboard accessibility
All interactive elements need to be accessed and activated by a keyboard alone ([2.1 Keyboard Accessible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard-accessible))
- Tabbing should be used to access standalone controls (buttons, links, widgets), and arrow keys should be used to navigate within a composite control (group of standalone controls, list of checkboxes).
- Some assistive technologies have keyboard combinations that override those of a web page, so don't rely on keyboard shortcuts as the only alternative to mouse actions.

## Screen reader information

Top three screen readers for computers ([data from WebAIM](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/), August 2019):
- NVDA (Windows)
- JAWS (Windows)
- VoiceOver (Mac)

Top three screen readers for mobile devices ([data from WebAIM](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/), August 2019):

Keep in mind that just like there are different browser implementations, there are also different assistive technologies and their behaviors can vary.
