At GitHub, our design teams use Figma as our single source of truth, collaboration, and exploration. We currently _only_ provide access to our Figma organization to members of our GitHub team. Public access any shared libraries and files is available from our [Figma Community page](https://www.figma.com/@primer).

- [GitHub Primer Design](https://primer.style/design)

### Team libraries

We use Figma to distribute Primer through it's team libraries. Each library covers a different part of the system allowing a designer to only use what is needed. Any team within GitHub's Figma organization can create and distribute their own team/project specific libraries, but all of the core asset libraries for Primer can be found in the Primer team's "[Core libraries](https://www.figma.com/files/797266083973274396/project/8172024/Core-libraries)" project. They include the following:

- [Primer Primitives](https://www.figma.com/file/B5XPE8IwGPIZDAvN7jqWqx/Primer-Primitives): All of the color, type, and spacing styles used within Primer.
- [Primer Web](https://www.figma.com/file/GCvY3Qv8czRgZgvl1dG6lp/Primer-Web): UI components used to design for GitHub's web interfaces.
- [Primer Mobile](https://www.figma.com/file/csCViryWkkXwBsK1aLrO0X/Primer-Mobile): UI components used to design for GitHub's native mobile platforms.
- [Octicons](https://www.figma.com/file/1ljgTFkT5NKNRfq5hw07JQ/Octicons): GitHub's custom icon library.

### Interface templates

In addition to asset libraries for components and styles, template libraries are also to be used to jump start the design process.

- [Primer Interfaces](https://www.figma.com/file/Y2xJLFBrU7yyiDLlEkQXcF/Primer-Interfaces): Templates for common views and UI patterns found within GitHub's web product.
- [Primer Email](https://www.figma.com/file/MZM32u6Q80DOvOGlDCNIyc/Primer-Email): Templates used to design product emails for GitHub.

## Collaboration

All GitHub members have read-only access to all GitHub design files and edit access to files within their team. You can leave [Figma comments](https://help.figma.com/article/44-comments) to provide feedback and use [issues](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issues) to document design exploration, track decisions and progress. The design team values [incremental correctness](https://github.com/github/product-design/blob/master/principles-and-practices.md#incremental-correctness), so share early and share often.

## Support

GitHub's Figma organization is currently maintained by our design systems team. For any questions or comments please reach out to us either in our Slack [#design-systems]() channel or by leaving an issue in the github/design-systems repo. The design systems team also offers weekly Figma office hours on Tuesday's which are hosted by [@ashygee](https://github.com/ashygee). Please reach out to them for the calendar invite.
